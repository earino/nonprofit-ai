## The Prompt

```
Write a personalized Donor Impact Report that shows exactly what a specific gift accomplished for [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The Donor Impact Report should:
- Be 300-450 words, 7th–8th grade reading level, and use [TONE: FORMAL (precise, for foundations/board); WARM (professional, friendly, plain language); CASUAL (conversational for long-time/peer donors)].
- Include sections in this order: Title/Subject; Salutation; Opening thank-you with [DONOR NAME], [GIFT AMOUNT], [GIFT DATE]; Outcomes and attribution; Beneficiary story; Program update; What’s next (no ask); Signature block.
- Attribute impact honestly: connect [GIFT AMOUNT] to [PROGRAM NAME] outcomes during [TIMEFRAME], using [ATTRIBUTION LOGIC: per-unit costs/portion of program/pooled funding]. Example: “At $100 per toolkit, your $5,000 funded 50 toolkits.”
- Provide concrete metrics: [KEY METRICS: # served, outputs, short outcomes] with units, dates, and baselines where available.
- Include one brief beneficiary vignette [STORY], honor [CONSENT STATUS], and anonymize if [ANONYMIZE:YES]. Avoid identifying details without consent.
- Add a brief program update: status, milestones, challenges and how addressed, and next milestone in [NEXT UPDATE WINDOW].
- Personalize throughout: use [DONOR NAME] 2-3 times, reference [DONOR INTEREST/RESTRICTION], and acknowledge past engagement [PRIOR TOUCHPOINTS] if relevant.
- Note gift type [RESTRICTED/UNRESTRICTED] and reflect appropriate framing.
- Include a photo suggestion and 1–2 sentence caption + alt text [PHOTO NOTES] or write “No photo available.”
- Close with gratitude and a clear non-ask next step (e.g., “We’ll share your next update in [CADENCE: QUARTERLY/ANNUAL]”).
- Sign by [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE] (ideally Program lead + Development), with direct contact info.

Focus on specificity, humility, and clarity. Avoid clichés (“now more than ever,” “life-changing” without proof), jargon, and over-claiming credit. Use plain language, numbers with sources [DATA SOURCE], and truthful attribution when gifts are pooled. The report should feel human, special, and accountable—something a donor could forward proudly.
