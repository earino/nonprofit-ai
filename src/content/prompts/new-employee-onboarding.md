## The Prompt

```
You are creating a New Employee Onboarding Checklist for a nonprofit organization. This checklist will guide [ORGANIZATION NAME] through onboarding a new [ROLE] in [DEPARTMENT], supervised by [SUPERVISOR NAME], starting on [START DATE].

SECTION 1 — REQUIRED INPUTS (complete before generating)
Organization Context:
- Organization name: [ORGANIZATION NAME]
- Staff size: [5–10 / 11–25 / 26–50 / 50+]
- Work setting: [IN-PERSON / REMOTE / HYBRID]
- Location (state/country): [STATE/COUNTRY]
- Compliance needs (check all): [Youth-serving / Healthcare / Government-funded / Data privacy (GDPR/HIPAA) / None]

Role Details:
- New hire role: [ROLE]
- Department: [DEPARTMENT]
- Supervisor: [SUPERVISOR NAME]
- Start date: [START DATE]
- Executive Director (for welcome email): [EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NAME]

Team Structure (write “N/A” if not applicable; tasks default to Operations Coordinator, then Executive Director):
- HR/Operations contact: [NAME or N/A]
- IT contact: [NAME or N/A]
- Finance contact: [NAME or N/A]
- Facilities contact (if applicable): [NAME or N/A]

Tools Your Organization Uses (write “None” if not applicable):
- CRM/case management: [SYSTEM NAME or None]
- Payroll/HRIS: [SYSTEM NAME or None]
- Communication tools: [Zoom, Slack, Teams, etc. or None]
- Password manager: [1Password, LastPass, etc. or None]

Tone:
- [WARM AND PROFESSIONAL] (default) OR [FORMAL] (recommended for government-funded/healthcare settings)

SECTION 2 — CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS
Structure and Timeline (in this order):
1) Pre-Start
2) Day 1 (limit to 5–7 essential tasks)
3) Week 1 (Days 2–5)
4) Weeks 2–4
5) 30/60/90-Day Milestones
6) Ongoing (recurring items)

Task Table Format (each task must include):
- Columns: Priority [Essential/Optional] | Task (≤12 words, specific) | Owner [HR/OPS/IT/SUPERVISOR/FINANCE/FACILITIES/PROGRAMS/DEVELOPMENT/New Hire] | Due Date/Window | Link/Resource [INSERT LINK] | Notes (low-cost alternative/workaround)
- Define “low-cost alternative” as free/open-source or manual workaround (e.g., Google Forms instead of paid HRIS).
- If no HR/IT, assign to Operations Coordinator; if none, assign to Executive Director.
- Accessibility: use plain language (8th-grade level), ensure screen-reader-friendly table headers, add [ALT-TEXT PLACEHOLDER] where visuals are referenced.

Examples:
- Good: “Send offer letter with salary, benefits, start date” | Owner: HR | Due: Day -14 | Link: [Template] | Notes: Use free e-sign
- Bad (too vague): “Orient new hire to organizational culture”

Content to Include (adapt to [STATE/COUNTRY] and [COMPLIANCE NEEDS]):
- Compliance: offer/handbook acknowledgment; I-9; W-4/state tax; E-Verify/background checks (if required); confidentiality; child-safeguarding (if youth-serving); DEI commitment; harassment prevention; safety training.
- IT/Facilities: email, calendar, shared drives; [CRM/CASE MGMT] access/training; [PAYROLL/HRIS] setup; comms tools (Zoom/Slack/Teams); MFA enrollment; password manager; equipment issue/return form; key card/office access/parking (if applicable).
- Culture/Mission: ED welcome email; mission/values; equity and community norms; program overview; site tour or virtual visit; volunteer/beneficiary interaction guidelines.
- Role Clarity/Development: 30/60/90-day goals linked to strategic plan; supervisor 1:1 cadence; onboarding buddy; training plan (systems/data/privacy/safety); shadowing schedule.
- Cross-Team Intros: Programs, Development, Finance, Comms, IT (30-min meet-and-greets); donor/funder stewardship basics (thank-you protocol, confidentiality, brand guidelines).
- Small-Team Pacing: mark essentials vs. optional; realistic time blocks; alternatives if no HRIS (shared Google Sheet/Asana checklist).
- Measurement: Week 1/Day 30/Day 60/Day 90 check-ins; survey links; success metrics—system access complete by Day 1; training completion 100% by Day 30; first deliverable by Day 30; 90-day goals 75% complete by Day 90.
- Psychological Safety & Data Security: buddy system; feedback survey; confidentiality; MFA; password manager; least-privilege access.

SECTION 3 — OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS
Deliver three clearly labeled sections:
1) Onboarding Overview (250–350 words total)

- Include line: “Checklist owners: [HR/OPS CONTACT] and [SUPERVISOR NAME].”
- Tone per selection; inclusive, plain language; avoid clichés.
- Note accessibility and pacing considerations for small teams.

2) Task Checklist Table

- Use checkboxes in Task text for printable version (e.g., “☐ Set up email and calendar access”).

- Team Introduction Email from [SUPERVISOR NAME] to staff (send Day -3).
- Training Calendar Invite from [HR/OPS CONTACT] (send Day -5; includes holds for Week 1 trainings and 1:1s).

- Day 1 limited to 5–7 essential tasks.
- Every task has an assigned owner and due window.
- Low-cost alternatives/workarounds provided where relevant.
