## The Prompt

Write a warm, appreciative thank-you letter for a first-time donor who gave $[AMOUNT] to [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Express genuine gratitude for their support
- Explain the specific impact of their gift (e.g., "Your $50 provides...")
- Make the donor feel like part of our community
- Include a subtle invitation to stay connected (social media, newsletter, etc.)
- Be 200-300 words in length
- Use a [FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL] tone
- Reference this campaign or appeal: [CAMPAIGN NAME]
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should make the donor feel valued and appreciated, not just like a transaction. Avoid over-the-top language or making another ask.

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[AMOUNT]** with the actual donation amount
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL]** with your preferred tone (warm is recommended for first-time donors)
4. Replace **[CAMPAIGN NAME]** with the specific appeal or campaign they responded to (e.g., "our Year-End Appeal" or "our Spring Food Drive")
5. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign the letter (e.g., "Sarah Johnson, Executive Director")
6. Optional: Add specific details about your programs or impact metrics

## Example Output

Dear [Donor Name],

Thank you so much for your generous gift of $50 to Hometown Food Bank. Your first donation to our organization means the world to us!

Your contribution will provide 200 nutritious meals to families in our community who are facing food insecurity. That's 200 times a child won't go to bed hungry, a senior will have fresh vegetables, or a parent can focus on finding work instead of finding food. Your support makes this possible.

We're so grateful to welcome you to our community of compassionate supporters. Together, we're building a future where everyone has access to healthy, nutritious food.

If you'd like to stay connected and see the impact of your gift, we'd love for you to follow us on Facebook @HometownFoodBank or sign up for our monthly email newsletter at www.hometownfoodbank.org/newsletter.

Thank you again for your kindness and generosity. We couldn't do this work without friends like you.

With deep gratitude,

Sarah Johnson
Executive Director
Hometown Food Bank

## Pro Tips

1. **Send quickly**: Mail thank-you letters within 48 hours of receiving the gift for maximum impact
2. **Personalize when possible**: If you know why they gave (event attendee, social media campaign, etc.), reference it
3. **Add a handwritten note**: A brief handwritten P.S. can make the letter feel even more personal
4. **Include impact metrics**: Specific numbers ("your $50 provides 200 meals") are more compelling than vague statements
5. **Avoid asking again**: This is purely a thank-you—no asks! You'll have opportunities later to invite them to give again
6. **Test your tone**: Ask a colleague to read it and ensure it sounds genuine, not robotic or over-the-top
