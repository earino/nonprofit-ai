## The Prompt

```
Write a warm, appreciative thank-you letter for a first-time donor who gave
$[AMOUNT] to [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Express genuine gratitude for their support
- Explain the specific impact of their gift (e.g., "Your $50 provides...")
- Make the donor feel like part of our community
- Include a subtle invitation to stay connected (social media, newsletter, etc.)
- Be 200-300 words in length
- Use a [FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL] tone
- Reference this campaign or appeal: [CAMPAIGN NAME]
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should make the donor feel valued and appreciated, not just like a
transaction. Avoid over-the-top language or making another ask.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[AMOUNT]** with the actual donation amount
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL]** with your preferred tone (warm is recommended for first-time donors)
4. Replace **[CAMPAIGN NAME]** with the specific appeal or campaign they responded to (e.g., "our Year-End Appeal" or "our Spring Food Drive")
5. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign the letter (e.g., "Sarah Johnson, Executive Director")
6. Optional: Add specific details about your programs or impact metrics

> I aim to help craft a heartfelt thank-you letter, but I notice you've included placeholder text in brackets for key details like the donation amount, organization name, campaign, tone preference, and signer information. Would you please provide those specific details? That way, I can write a fully personalized letter that authentically reflects your organization and the donor's gift.

For example, knowing the actual donation amount and campaign will help me describe the tangible impact, while knowing your preferred tone will ensure the letter matches your organization's voice. Once you share those details, I'll draft a warm thank-you letter that makes your donor feel truly appreciated and connected to your cause.

## Pro Tips

1. **Send quickly**: Mail thank-you letters within 48 hours of receiving the gift for maximum impact
2. **Personalize when possible**: If you know why they gave (event attendee, social media campaign, etc.), reference it
3. **Add a handwritten note**: A brief handwritten P.S. can make the letter feel even more personal
4. **Include impact metrics**: Specific numbers ("your $50 provides 200 meals") are more compelling than vague statements
5. **Avoid asking again**: This is purely a thank-you—no asks! You'll have opportunities later to invite them to give again
6. **Test your tone**: Ask a colleague to read it and ensure it sounds genuine, not robotic or over-the-top
