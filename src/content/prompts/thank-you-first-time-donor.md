## The Prompt

```
Write a warm, appreciative thank-you letter for a first-time donor who gave
$[AMOUNT] to [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Express genuine gratitude for their support
- Explain the specific impact of their gift (e.g., "Your $50 provides...")
- Make the donor feel like part of our community
- Include a subtle invitation to stay connected (social media, newsletter, etc.)
- Be 200-300 words in length
- Use a [FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL] tone
- Reference this campaign or appeal: [CAMPAIGN NAME]
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should make the donor feel valued and appreciated, not just like a
transaction. Avoid over-the-top language or making another ask.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[AMOUNT]** with the actual donation amount
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL]** with your preferred tone (warm is recommended for first-time donors)
4. Replace **[CAMPAIGN NAME]** with the specific appeal or campaign they responded to (e.g., "our Year-End Appeal" or "our Spring Food Drive")
5. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign the letter (e.g., "Sarah Johnson, Executive Director")
6. Optional: Add specific details about your programs or impact metrics

## Pro Tips

1. **Send quickly**: Mail thank-you letters within 48 hours of receiving the gift for maximum impact
2. **Personalize when possible**: If you know why they gave (event attendee, social media campaign, etc.), reference it
3. **Add a handwritten note**: A brief handwritten P.S. can make the letter feel even more personal
4. **Include impact metrics**: Specific numbers ("your $50 provides 200 meals") are more compelling than vague statements
5. **Avoid asking again**: This is purely a thank-you—no asks! You'll have opportunities later to invite them to give again
6. **Test your tone**: Ask a colleague to read it and ensure it sounds genuine, not robotic or over-the-top
