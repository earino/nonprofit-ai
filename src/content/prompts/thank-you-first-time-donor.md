## The Prompt

```
Draft a personalized first-time donor thank-you letter for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to send within 48 hours of [DONOR NAME]’s gift.

The letter should:
- Be 150-250 words and feel human, warm, and concise.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (polished, respectful), WARM (friendly, heartfelt), or CASUAL (conversational, approachable). Default: WARM.
- Open with the donor’s name and clear acknowledgment of the gift: “[DONOR NAME], thank you for your gift of [AMOUNT] received on [DATE RECEIVED].”
- Include a one-line mission anchor: “[ORGANIZATION NAME] [MISSION ONE-LINER].”
- Specify concrete impact tied to the gift and program: “[PROGRAM/IMPACT AREA]” and a proof point ([IMPACT PROOF POINT]). If no data is provided, describe qualitative impact without inventing numbers. Example: “Your gift helps a new mom meet with a lactation counselor this week.”
- Welcome them as a first-time supporter and, if known, reference context: “[HOW THEY CAME TO US: event/peer-to-peer/online].”
- Keep donor-centric language (aim for a ‘you’ to ‘we’ ratio of ~2:1), simple sentences, and 6th–8th grade readability.
- Avoid asks for another gift; you may include one non-monetary next step (choose one): invite to [TOUR/NEWSLETTER/SOCIAL HANDLE/UPCOMING VOLUNTEER ORIENTATION].
- Use this order: greeting; warm thanks + gift details; mission anchor; impact statement; welcome line; brief human detail/story image; gentle non-ask next step; sincere closing; signature.
- Include an optional acknowledgment line if needed: “Your contribution is tax-deductible; no goods or services were provided.” [ADJUST FOR YOUR JURISDICTION]
- End with a real sign-off from leadership: [SIGNER NAME], [TITLE], [DIRECT CONTACT INFO]. Optional P.S. reinforcing impact or the non-ask next step.
- If any bracketed detail is unknown, omit that sentence rather than guessing.

Quality matters: Be specific, human, and sincere. Avoid clichés (“on behalf of…,” “we couldn’t do it without you”), jargon, acronyms without explanation, emojis, or multiple exclamation points. The goal is to make the donor feel seen, know their impact, and feel welcomed—without being asked for more.
