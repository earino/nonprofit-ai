## The Prompt

```
Create a donor upgrade ask to convert a recent one-time donor to a monthly sustainer for [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The [content type] should:
- Specify channel: [CHANNEL: EMAIL/LETTER/SMS]. If email, include a compelling subject line (3 options) and preheader; if letter, include a headline.
- Open with warm thanks referencing [DONOR FIRST NAME], their [LAST GIFT AMOUNT], what it supported ([PROGRAM/CAUSE]), and a specific result ([RESULT/IMPACT FROM LAST GIFT]); mention timing ([TIMING/TRIGGER]).
- Introduce monthly giving as “spreading your impact throughout the year,” emphasizing donor control and ease: [FLEXIBILITY LANGUAGE: pause/adjust/cancel anytime].
- Present simple math with 2–3 options: [MONTHLY AMOUNT OPTIONS] and their annual totals [ANNUAL TOTALS], tied to concrete outcomes [IMPACT MATH EXAMPLE].
- Add social proof to reduce risk: [SOCIAL PROOF] (e.g., “Join 200+ neighbors giving monthly” or a short quote).
- Address top objections succinctly: “I already gave” (affirm impact, monthly keeps it going) and “another subscription” (no contract, change anytime, receipts for taxes).
- Include a clear CTA with button-style language [CTA BUTTON TEXT] linked to [EASY ENROLLMENT LINK]; provide a plain-text fallback link.
- Offer an optional gentle nudge (e.g., “[MATCH OFFER]” or “Start by [SOFT DEADLINE/DATE]”) without pressure.
- Close with gratitude and a donor-first frame (“you make this possible”); invite replies for questions.
- Add a P.S. restating flexibility, suggesting a modest entry amount (e.g., $15/month), and repeating the link.
- Length: 250–350 words, 6–8 short paragraphs, 6th–8th grade reading level, mobile-friendly, skimmable.
- Tone: [TONE] = FORMAL (precise, respectful), WARM (friendly, relationship-centered), CASUAL (concise, plainspoken/SMS-friendly). Sign by [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE], with [REPLY CONTACT].

Quality principles: Be donor-centric (use “you”), specific, and concrete; avoid jargon, guilt, or clichés. Use real numbers and plain language. Keep the ask modest and flexible. If any bracketed data is unknown, write a neutral, truthful alternative. Ensure links are clear and easy to tap on mobile.
