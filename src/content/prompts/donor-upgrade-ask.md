## The Prompt

```
Write a persuasive but gentle email asking a one-time donor to become a monthly
supporter of [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Acknowledge their previous gift(s): [DONOR HISTORY]
- Explain why monthly giving is valuable to the organization (predictable funding, planning, sustainability)
- Show the cumulative impact of monthly giving vs. one-time (e.g., "$25/month = $300/year")
- Make it feel like joining a special community ("sustaining donors", "monthly partners")
- Address common objections without being defensive (budget flexibility, easy to pause/cancel)
- Provide specific suggested amounts: [LOW], [MEDIUM], [HIGH] per month
- Explain what each monthly amount specifically provides
- Include clear call-to-action with easy sign-up process
- Emphasize convenience (automatic, set-it-and-forget-it)
- Be 250-350 words
- Use a [WARM/ENTHUSIASTIC/FRIENDLY] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The email should make monthly giving feel like an upgrade or VIP opportunity, not
a burden. Emphasize the donor's increased impact and the organizational benefits.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
2. Replace **[DONOR HISTORY]** with their giving (e.g., "You've given three times in the past year")
3. Replace **[LOW], [MEDIUM], [HIGH]** with suggested monthly amounts (e.g., $15, $25, $50)
4. For each amount, specify what it provides monthly
5. Replace **[WARM/ENTHUSIASTIC/FRIENDLY]** with tone
6. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign
7. Add link to your monthly giving signup page

## Pro Tips

1. **Timing is everything**: Ask 3-6 months after second or third one-time gift
2. **Make math easy**: Show annual impact clearly ($25/month = $300/year provides X)
3. **Remove friction**: Link directly to pre-filled form with suggested amount
4. **Address concerns proactively**: "Cancel anytime, no hassle" or "Adjust your amount whenever you need"
5. **Create identity**: Use special terms like "Sustaining Circle" or "Monthly Champions"
6. **Show stability value**: Explain how monthly gifts help you plan programs and budget
7. **Test amounts**: Try different suggested amounts with different segments
8. **Follow up**: If they don't convert, try again in 6 months with different framing
