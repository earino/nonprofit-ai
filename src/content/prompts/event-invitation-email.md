## The Prompt

```
Write a high-converting event invitation email for [ORGANIZATION NAME] inviting [AUDIENCE SEGMENT] to [EVENT NAME].

The email should:
- Open with a 1–2 sentence “why now” that links the event to [GOAL/WHY NOW] and relevance for [AUDIENCE SEGMENT].
- Put What/When/Where in the first 3 lines: [EVENT NAME], [DATE], [TIME] [TIME ZONE], [LOCATION/VENUE or VIRTUAL LINK], [CITY], [PRICE or FREE].
- Include a primary CTA above the fold: “Register now” linking to [REGISTRATION LINK], plus an [ADD-TO-CALENDAR LINK] (ICS/Google).
- Highlight 1–2 unique draws (e.g., [SPECIAL GUESTS/SPEAKERS], live demo, limited capacity) to create gentle FOMO without pressure.
- List 2–4 attendee benefits tailored to [AUDIENCE SEGMENT] (e.g., donors = impact briefing; volunteers = skills/networking; community = resources/services).
- Provide logistics/access: [ACCESSIBILITY DETAILS], [CHILDCARE/TRANSPORTATION], parking/transit, and virtual access notes if applicable.
- Set an action timeline: “Please RSVP by [RSVP DEADLINE]” and offer a reply-to option at [CONTACT EMAIL/PHONE].
- Add a line for non-attendees: “Can’t join? We’ll share a recap/recording—register to receive it,” and encourage forwarding to a colleague.
- Deliver 3 subject lines (<55 characters) and 1 preview text (<90 characters), all specific to [AUDIENCE SEGMENT] and avoiding spammy words.
- Keep body 200–280 words, with 2–4 short paragraphs and a tiny bulleted list for benefits; write at a 6th–8th grade reading level.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (for funders/officials; precise, respectful), WARM (for donors/community; appreciative, invitational), CASUAL (for volunteers/peers; friendly, concise).
- Close with a real-person signoff: [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE], [CONTACT EMAIL/PHONE].

Aim for clarity, brevity, and inclusivity. Avoid clichés (“don’t miss out!”), jargon/acronyms (or define them), hype, and multiple exclamation points. Write mobile-first with scannable lines, concrete details, and a clear single CTA that makes registration effortless.
