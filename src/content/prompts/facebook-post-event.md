- Short, scannable sentences and line breaks

Content structure (in this order):

2) Essential details (Lines 1–2, visible before “See more”):
   - [EVENT NAME] | [DATE] | [TIME] | [LOCATION or VIRTUAL LINK] | [COST]
3) Why it matters (1 sentence): Who it’s for + key benefit.
4) Brief description (1–2 sentences): [SPEAKERS/HIGHLIGHTS or KEY TOPICS]. Add only relevant logistics: [ACCESSIBILITY], [CHILDCARE], [LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION], [PARKING/TRANSIT], [COVID/SAFETY].
5) Clear CTA: Strong verb + [REGISTRATION LINK or FACEBOOK EVENT URL]. If [UTM = Yes], append [UTM PARAMETERS]. Prompt readers to tap “Interested” or “Going.”
6) Ethical urgency (only if true): [DEADLINE / LIMITED SEATS / EARLY-BIRD ENDS DATE].

Formatting:
- Emojis: 0–2 max (use only if they add clarity/warmth)
- Hashtags: 1–3 relevant, at the end
- Tags: Include [PARTNERS TO TAG] and [VENUE TO TAG] if provided
- Avoid: Jargon, unexplained acronyms, clichés, excessive exclamation points

Tone:
- Choose [FORMAL], [WARM] (default), or [CASUAL] and keep it consistent

Voice & sign-off:
- Use organizational voice. No signature unless [SPOKESPERSON NAME/TITLE] is provided.

ALSO PROVIDE

1) Image suggestion:

  - Speaker headshot with a short quote overlay
  - Simple text graphic with event name/date/time/location
  - Relevant action shot at the venue or program site
- Include 20–30 word alt-text for accessibility.

2) Pinned first comment (30–50 words):
- Add helpful logistics (agenda, parking/transit, what to bring) and a contact for questions: [CONTACT EMAIL/PHONE].

3) A/B test variation:
- Provide a second caption with a different opening hook only. Keep all other details identical so you can isolate hook performance.

OUTPUT FORMAT (return in this order)
- Caption Version A (100–150 words)
- Caption Version B (different hook; 100–150 words)
- Image suggestion (1–2 sentences)
- Alt-text (20–30 words)
- Pinned first comment (30–50 words)

QUALITY CHECKLIST (the AI should)

- Keep emojis ≤2 and hashtags 1–3, relevant only
- Tag partners/venue when provided
- Avoid walls of text, jargon, and clichés

POSTING TIPS (include in output)
