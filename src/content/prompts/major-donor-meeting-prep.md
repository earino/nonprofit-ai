How to use

- Attendees (names/titles) + roles: [Lead Asker] [Timekeeper] [Note-taker]
- Authority to commit (decision rights): [WHO can say yes to what]
- Primary goal (specific): [OUTCOME]
- If solicitation: Ask amount/range [$], purpose [PROGRAM/PROJECT], timing [WHEN], who asks [NAME], pause plan [min. 5–10 seconds]

Output requirements
- 250–350 words, bullets only, no long paragraphs
- Concrete, donor-centric, plain language; no jargon/clichés
- Mark unknowns as [TO VERIFY]; do not invent facts
- Fit to 1 page; optimize for skimming by a busy ED in under 3 minutes

Prioritization by meeting length
- 15 min: Include Header; Objective & Strategy (with Ask if applicable); 3 Talking Points; 4 Questions; Post-Meeting Plan. Condense Snapshot to 1–2 bullets. Omit Logistics unless critical.
- 30–60 min: Include all required sections; add Relationship History, Likely Concerns, What Not to Say, and brief Logistics with agenda.

Create the 1-page briefing with these sections (omit optional items if needed to meet word limit)
1) Header (always)
- Date/time/location; attendees + roles; authority to commit; primary desired outcome
2) Donor Snapshot (3–4 bullets; 1–2 bullets if 15 min)
- Background/connection; last gift/lifetime total; capacity indicators + vehicles (DAF/stock/cash); motivations aligned to mission/program
3) Relationship History (2–3 bullets; skip for first-time)
- Recent touchpoints; who knows them; invites/stewardship; sensitivities
4) Meeting Objective & Strategy (always)
- Primary goal; 1–2 acceptable fallbacks (e.g., site visit, spouse/advisor intro, multi-year exploration)
- If solicitation: The Ask (exact amount, purpose, timing, who asks, exact phrasing, pause plan)
5) Tailored Talking Points (3–5 bullets)
- Beneficiary-centered impact tied to program/project; include 1–2 proof points (metric/story)
6) Questions to Ask (4–6 open-ended)
- Interests, timing, decision process, asset preference (DAF/stock), recognition, who else to involve
7) Likely Concerns + Responses (3–4 pairs; include if applicable)
- Short, respectful replies that bridge back to impact
8) What NOT to Say (3–5 bullets; optional but recommended)
- Confidential issues, crisis framing, politics, overpromising, jargon
9) Logistics & Choreography (brief; include agenda for 30–60 min)
- 20–45 min agenda; materials to bring; follow-up artifacts; accessibility note (print at 12–14 pt, high contrast if sharing)
10) Post-Meeting Plan (always)
- Thank-you plan (owner, within 48 hours); next steps with owners/due dates; CRM updates (contact report, next step, stage)
Footer
- Prepared by [STAFF NAME/TITLE] on [DATE] — Version [X] (Updated [DATE])

Conditional guidance
- First-time: Skip Relationship History; add “Research Summary” bullet (public sources); focus Questions on discovery
- Cultivation (no ask): Emphasize Questions/next engagement; skip Ask
- Stewardship: Add “Impact Update” bullets tied to donor’s last gift; lead with gratitude

Example snippets (for reference—adapt and keep concise)
- Donor Snapshot: “Sarah Chen, VP at Series C fintech; introduced by board member Tom (2022). Giving: $5K (2022), $10K (2023) to scholarships; lifetime $15K. Capacity: Presidio Heights homeowner; serves on 2 nonprofit boards. Motivation: Equity in youth sports; former scholarship athlete.”
