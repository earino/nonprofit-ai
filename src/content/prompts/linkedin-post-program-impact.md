## The Prompt

```
Write a LinkedIn post that spotlights a concrete program impact for [ORGANIZATION NAME], optimized for reach from [AUTHOR NAME/TITLE]’s personal account.

The LinkedIn post should:
- Open with a bold hook stat or outcome in the first sentence: [IMPACT STAT] in [TIMEFRAME] (include [BASELINE OR COMPARISON] if relevant).
- Use 3–5 short paragraphs (1–2 sentences each) for easy scanning.
- Write in first-person singular from [AUTHOR NAME/TITLE], briefly tying the win to [PROGRAM NAME] and our mission in [GEOGRAPHY/COMMUNITY].
- Include one human-centered micro-story: [BENEFICIARY FIRST NAME/ROLE – with consent], what changed, and how the program enabled it. Optional: a short, specific quote [QUOTE – optional].
- Provide 1–2 concrete metrics (e.g., percent increase, number served, timeframe); avoid ranges or vague claims.
- Tag collaborators and funders naturally: [PARTNER TAGS] (only those directly involved).
- Add one clear CTA with a strong verb: [CTA] and link if applicable [LINK].
- Include 3–5 relevant hashtags: [HASHTAGS] (mix sector + local + program-specific).
- Suggest an accompanying visual: [VISUAL TYPE] and write a one-sentence alt text for accessibility.
- Keep language plain, strengths-based, and respectful; no confidential details.
- Tone: [TONE] = FORMAL (data-forward, no emojis), WARM (professional, human, 0–1 tasteful emoji max), CASUAL (approachable, plain language, 0–1 emoji).
- Length: 100–180 words; no sign-off line needed.

Quality matters: Be specific (who, where, how many, when). Avoid clichés (“changing lives,” “giving voice to the voiceless,” “at-risk,” “underserved”), jargon, and acronyms without context. Lead with impact, then a brief story, then the CTA. Tagging partners and posting from the ED/leader’s personal account typically earns 5–10x more reach. Ensure consent for names/photos; use people-first, dignity-centered language.
