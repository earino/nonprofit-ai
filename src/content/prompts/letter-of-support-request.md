## The Prompt

```
Draft a partner request package to secure strong Letters of Support for a grant submission.

The Letter of Support Request package should:
- Be tailored for [PARTNER NAME/ORG] regarding [PROGRAM NAME] and [FUNDING OPPORTUNITY] led by [ORGANIZATION NAME].
- Include 3 subject line options and a concise email body (150-200 words) with the first line clearly stating: DUE [DEADLINE DATE, TIME, TIME ZONE] via [SUBMISSION METHOD].
- Provide a 1-paragraph program summary (80-120 words) highlighting need, approach, community impact in [GEOGRAPHY], and equity considerations relevant to this partner.
- List 5-7 specific talking points for their letter: their role/credibility; how we collaborate now; concrete commitments (quantify: referrals/space/staff time/data-sharing); anticipated community benefit; alignment with [FUNDING OPPORTUNITY] goals; evaluation touchpoints; sustainability.
- Specify letter requirements: 1 page (250-350 words), on letterhead, signed by [SIGNATORY NAME/TITLE], PDF to [EMAIL/PORTAL], include grant name and [ORGANIZATION NAME].
- Include a customizable draft letter template with [BRACKETED FIELDS] and 2-3 optional personalization sentences so letters aren’t identical.
- Offer support: “We can draft for your edits” and provide a 2–3 sentence short version if they’re under extreme time pressure.
- Set a respectful follow-up plan: initial ask (2–3 weeks out), reminder at 1 week, 48-hour check-in, day-of confirmation; include who to cc and [SENDER NAME/TITLE/CONTACT].
- Provide a mini tracking checklist for multiple letters: Partner | Signer | Status | Due | Received | Notes.

Tone options: [FORMAL (federal/universities/health systems)] / [WARM (most community partners/foundations)] / [CASUAL (longtime collaborators)].

Quality matters: ask for concrete, time-bound commitments; use plain language; avoid clichés (“synergy,” “unique”), excessive acronyms, or over-promising on their behalf. Double-check correct funder name, dates, and that letters are on letterhead with signature.
