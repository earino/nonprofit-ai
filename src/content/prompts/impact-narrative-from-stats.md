## The Prompt

```
Create a donor- and funder-ready impact narrative that turns program statistics into a human-centered story for [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The impact narrative should:
- Open with either a 1–2 sentence human vignette [BENEFICIARY PROFILE/NAME; STORY CONSENT: [STORY CONSENT STATUS]] or a surprising stat; connect to [PROGRAM NAME] in [GEOGRAPHY] without trauma detail.
- Add one-line mission/program context: [MISSION LINE], [TIMEFRAME], [AUDIENCE SERVED].
- Present 3–5 key outcomes from [PRIMARY OUTCOME METRICS] with a clear comparison to [COMPARISON/BASELINE].
- Translate at least two numbers into relatable equivalents (e.g., “served 500 students = the entire [LOCAL SCHOOL/NEIGHBORHOOD]”).
- Include 1–2 qualitative insights from [SECONDARY/QUALITATIVE INSIGHTS] plus one short quote from [QUOTE SOURCE] (paraphrase if needed; respect dignity).
- Briefly cite credibility: one sentence on [DATA SOURCE/METHODOLOGY] and honest [LIMITATIONS] in plain language.
- Explain the “so what”: why these results matter for [COMMUNITY/ISSUE], noting where progress lagged or exceeded expectations.
- Suggest one simple visual (e.g., bar or before/after chart) with a title, labeled axes, data points, and a 1-sentence caption.
- Use first-person plural “we,” people-first phrasing; define acronyms once; avoid jargon, clichés, and over-claiming.
- Close with a specific next step for [DONOR SEGMENT/READERS] (e.g., [CALL TO ACTION]) and a brief “what’s next.”
- Length: 450–550 words with subheads: Story/Context; What Changed (Numbers); What It Means; How We Measured; What’s Next.
- Tone: [TONE] = FORMAL (grant/funder), WARM (donor newsletter), CASUAL (community update); confident yet humble.
- Sign-off: By [AUTHOR NAME], [AUTHOR/SIGN-OFF TITLE].

Quality matters: be concrete, balanced, and transparent. Avoid savior language and unverifiable claims. If any [BRACKETED] info is missing, use ethical placeholders and flag assumptions. Write for mixed audiences so funders can cite and donors can feel the impact.
