## The Prompt

```
Create an X/Twitter awareness thread for a nonprofit campaign using the inputs: [ORGANIZATION NAME], [MISSION IN 1 LINE], [TOPIC/ISSUE], [PRIMARY AUDIENCE], [GOAL/CTA], [KEY STAT], [BENEFICIARY SNAPSHOT—first name/role], [POLICY/CONTEXT], [LINK WITH UTM], [PARTNER/SPOKESPERSON HANDLES], [HASHTAG 1-2], [COUNTRY/LOCALE], [TONE], [THREAD LENGTH 5-8], [POST DATE/TIME].

The thread should:
- Produce [THREAD LENGTH] tweets; each 180–240 characters (never exceed 260); number them “(1/[N])…(N/[N]).” Total 1,200–1,800 characters.
- Structure: 1) Hook with surprising stat or question; 2) Problem in plain terms; 3) Human story (no saviorism); 4) What’s at stake (policy/community); 5) What works (your solution); 6) Clear CTA with link. Add up to 2 more tweets only if essential.
- Make each tweet stand alone yet read as a cohesive arc. Include 1-2 hashtags total across the thread.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (policy/press-ready), WARM (community/donor-friendly), CASUAL (youth/peer conversational).
- Write at grade 6–8 reading level; avoid jargon; use concrete nouns, strong verbs, and numbers.
- Attribute voice: first-person by [SPOKESPERSON NAME/TITLE] or organizational “we”—match consistently.
- Tag [PARTNER/SPOKESPERSON HANDLES] only where it adds credibility or reach; avoid over-tagging.
- Accessibility: suggest 2-3 rights-safe, low-cost visual ideas with ALT text (120–250 chars each).
- Provide A/B options for the hook (2) and CTA tweet (2) for testing.
- Include best timing recommendation (8–10am or 12–1pm weekdays) and scheduling note for [POST DATE/TIME].
- Add moderation toolkit: 2 concise, values-aligned replies to common misinformation; guidance to hide/mute/block per community guidelines.

Quality principles: prioritize accuracy, dignity, and clarity; avoid clichés (“game-changer,” “give voice”), fearmongering, and emoji overload; keep threads for high-importance topics (2–3x/month). Use a single tweet instead when sharing a quick update or link without needed nuance.
