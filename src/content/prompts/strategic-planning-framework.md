## The Prompt

```
Create a right-sized, nonprofit-specific Strategic Planning Framework for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to guide a [12/18/24]-month plan aligned to [MISSION SUMMARY] and the needs of [PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES/COMMUNITY].

The framework should:
- Use these inputs: size ([ANNUAL BUDGET], [STAFF FTE], [BOARD SIZE]), geography ([SERVICE AREA]), programs ([PROGRAMS]), funding mix ([FUNDING MIX]), constraints ([TOP 3 CONSTRAINTS]), sacred cows to assess ([SACRED COWS]), equity commitments ([EQUITY/LANGUAGE ACCESS]), facilitator ([FACILITATOR: YES/NO]), key dates ([KEY DATES]).
- Follow best-practice structure in this order: 1) Purpose & scope, 2) Environmental scan plan (internal/external), 3) Stakeholder engagement plan, 4) Mission/vision/values test, 5) 3–5 strategic priorities, 6) Strategies, 7) Year 1–2 objectives, 8) Implementation plan, 9) Metrics/dashboard, 10) Governance & decision rights, 11) Risks/assumptions, 12) Budget/resource implications, 13) Communications, 14) Review cadence.
- Propose a realistic process timeline (8–12 weeks) with meeting cadence, roles (Board, ED, staff, committee), and estimated hours per role to limit burden on a small team.
- Specify low-cost data sources (e.g., IRS 990s, Census/ACS, CHNAs, funder RFP trends, program outcomes, simple surveys/interviews) and who gathers what by when.
- Provide a stakeholder plan engaging board, staff, beneficiaries, funders, and partners; include 6–8 sample questions and accessible methods (listening sessions, short surveys).
- Convert SWOT into actionable choices (Start/Stop/Strengthen), including a “sacred cow” test with sunsetting criteria.
- Define 3–5 priorities; for each include 2–4 strategies and Year 1 SMART objectives with owners, timelines, dependencies, and rough resource estimates (dollars and staff time).
- Include a lean dashboard (6–10 KPIs across impact, fundraising, org health) with baselines, targets, and quarterly review cadence; add decision triggers and base/stretch/constrained scenarios.
- Outline governance: who decides, who consults, and how accountability is tracked (RACI + quarterly board check-ins).
- Add a communications plan (internal and external) and a one-page “plan-on-a-page” summary.
- Keep the final plan to 10–15 pages; include a 150–200 word executive summary template.
- Word count: 900–1,200 words. Tone: [FORMAL: board packet-ready/ WARM: community-accessible/ CASUAL: internal working doc]. Prepared by [EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NAME/TITLE] and [BOARD CHAIR NAME].

Make guidance concrete and feasible for limited capacity; avoid buzzwords and vague goals. Use measurable targets, realistic timelines, and community-centered language. Assume no outside facilitator if [FACILITATOR]=NO and include simple ground rules and tips.
