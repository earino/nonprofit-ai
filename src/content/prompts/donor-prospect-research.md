## The Prompt

```
Create a one-page Donor Prospect Research Brief for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to inform major gift cultivation of [PROSPECT NAME] using publicly available information only.

The brief should:
- Use this order and headings: 1) Header, 2) Snapshot, 3) Professional & Wealth Indicators, 4) Philanthropy & 990 Data, 5) Connections to [ORGANIZATION NAME], 6) Interests/Passions, 7) Cultivation Plan, 8) Risks/Considerations, 9) Sources, 10) Update Log.
- Header: Prospect name (incl. preferred name/pronouns), city/state, employer/title, connection level to org, Prepared by [NAME/ROLE], Date [DATE], For Internal Use Only.
- Snapshot (4 lines max): Estimated giving capacity range with confidence (Low/Med/High) + basis; top 2-3 affinity indicators; readiness/timing signals; recommended initial ask range tied to [PROGRAM/CASE].
- Professional & Wealth Indicators: current/past roles, business ownership, notable liquidity proxies (public company equity, real estate assessed values, exits) with brief basis. Avoid speculation.
- Philanthropy & 990 Data: top 3-5 gifts/orgs (size/recency when findable), board service, family foundation notes, cite 990/990-PF (org/year/URL).
- Connections to [ORGANIZATION NAME]: alumni/volunteer links, shared networks; list 2-3 warm intro pathways (Name—relationship—how to approach).
- Interests/Passions: causes, issue areas, quotes/memberships that signal affinity.
- Cultivation Plan: 3-5 specific next steps, likely channel, timing window, entry points (events, site visit, program leader).
- Risks/Considerations: reputational issues, conflicts, privacy flags (no sensitive categories). Note “Unknown” where data is absent.
- Sources: 5-8 citations with URLs and access dates (LinkedIn, news, company site, Guidestar/Candid, IRS 990-PF, SEC, real estate records).
- Update Log: blank lines for date/action/outcome.
- Length: 300–450 words; concise bullets; no walls of text.
- Tone: [TONE]=FORMAL (board/exec-ready), WARM (internal collaboration, default), CASUAL (working notes).

Quality: Be concrete and verifiable; quantify where possible; tie capacity to visible indicators; do not guess net worth or use stereotypes; avoid jargon/clichés; flag “Unverified” if not sourced. If [KNOWN DETAILS OR LINKS] are provided, prioritize them.
