## The Prompt

```
You are an expert nonprofit event strategist. Develop an event concept and theme brainstorm for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that balances creative differentiation with revenue and capacity realities.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN: Information-Gathering Worksheet
Fill in brackets with specific details. If unsure, leave blank—the AI will make reasonable assumptions and note them.

Essential Inputs (Required)
- [ORGANIZATION NAME]
- [MISSION/CAUSE] (1 sentence; e.g., “Ending food insecurity in rural communities”)
- [PRIMARY GOAL] (e.g., “Raise $25K net” or “Engage 50 new major donors”)
- [TARGET AUDIENCE] (be specific; e.g., “Young professionals 25–40, HHI $75K+, socially conscious”)
- [BUDGET RANGE] (e.g., “$8,000–12,000 all-in” or “Under $5K”)
- [STAFF CAPACITY] (e.g., “1 dev. dir. 10 hrs/wk x 8 wks + 1 volunteer coord. 5 hrs/wk”)
- [DATE OR SEASON] (e.g., “Spring 2025—Apr/May” or “Before FY end Jun 30”)
- [CITY/REGION] (e.g., “Portland, OR metro” or “Virtual—Pacific Northwest focus”)

Important Inputs (Highly Recommended)
- [NET REVENUE TARGET] (e.g., “$15,000 net after expenses”)
- [ATTENDANCE TARGET] (e.g., “75–100 in-person” or “200+ virtual”)
- [SPONSORSHIP GOAL] (e.g., “$10K from 3–5 sponsors” or “Not pursuing”)
- [PAST EVENTS]/[PAST EVENT RESULTS] (e.g., “2023 Trivia: 60 attendees, $4K net, fun but low $; 2022 Gala: 120 attendees, $18K net, high staff load”)
- [RISK TOLERANCE] (e.g., “Low—need proven” or “High—willing to experiment”)
- [ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS] (e.g., “Wheelchair accessible, ASL, sliding scale pricing”)
- [DIFFERENTIATORS/NEARBY EVENTS] (e.g., “3 local youth org 5Ks in fall—avoid 5K”)

Optional Inputs
- [VIRTUAL/HYBRID PREFERENCE] (e.g., “Prefer in-person, open to hybrid”)
- [BOARD PRIORITIES] (e.g., “Feature youth speakers” or “Include program tour”)
- [CAUSE/COMMUNITY PARTNERS] (e.g., “Local breweries, arts council, university”)
- [AVERAGE TICKET PRICE] (e.g., “$50–75” or “Free—donations only”)
- [TONE] Select ONE: FORMAL (board-facing, concise), WARM (donor-friendly, mission-forward), CASUAL (creative, plain language)
- [NAME/TITLE]
- [AUDIENCE] (e.g., “Executive Director + Board Development Committee”)
- [DATE]

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

1) EXECUTIVE SNAPSHOT (100–150 words)
- Primary Goal: [PRIMARY GOAL]
- Target Audience: [TARGET AUDIENCE]
- Success Metrics: Net revenue [NET REVENUE TARGET]; Attendance [ATTENDANCE TARGET]; Sponsorships [SPONSORSHIP GOAL]
- Key Constraints: Timeline ([DATE OR SEASON]); Location ([CITY/REGION]); Budget ([BUDGET RANGE]); Staff ([STAFF CAPACITY]); Risk ([RISK TOLERANCE]); Accessibility ([ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS]); Format ([VIRTUAL/HYBRID PREFERENCE])
- Mission Context: [1 sentence linking to MISSION/CAUSE]
- Competitive Note: [DIFFERENTIATORS/NEARBY EVENTS]
- Must-Include: [BOARD PRIORITIES]

2) EVENT CONCEPT PORTFOLIO (10–15 distinct concepts)
Requirements:
- At least 3 low-cost concepts (≤30% of [BUDGET RANGE])
- At least 2 hybrid or virtual options
- At least 2 scalable concepts (pilotable small → expand later)
- Mix formats: social, challenge/competition, educational, community, virtual

For each concept, provide exactly this structure (80–120 words):
[Concept Number]. [EVENT TITLE]
- Tagline/Theme: [1 compelling sentence]
- Mission Connection: [Specific, concrete tie to MISSION/CAUSE]
- Audience Fit: [Why TARGET AUDIENCE will attend; clear draw]
- Experience: [What attendees actually do—sensory and concrete]
- Venue/Season: [Venue type + ideal timing in [CITY/REGION]]
- Accessibility/Inclusion: [How it addresses ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS; inclusive pricing]
- Differentiation Hook: [What makes this distinct from DIFFERENTIATORS/NEARBY EVENTS]
- Revenue Model: Ticket price [range; align with/assume [AVERAGE TICKET PRICE]], fundraising mechanisms (e.g., peer-to-peer, auction-lite, pledges), sponsorable assets (e.g., named segments/stages, swag, program ads)
- Cost Drivers: [Top 3 expense categories]
- Capacity Intensity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH with brief reason]

Avoid clichés unless distinctively reimagined. If including a typical format, explain the twist (e.g., “Progressive Neighborhood Gala: 4 sites featuring food justice partners, walking tour storytelling” not “Annual gala”; “Micro-pledge stair climb in historic building with VR access” not “5K”).

3) COMPARISON MATRIX
Present as a markdown table with columns:
- Concept # and Title
- Mission Alignment (1–5)
- Net Revenue Potential (1–5)
- Audience Appeal (1–5)
- Differentiation (1–5)
- Feasibility/Capacity (1–5)
- TOTAL SCORE (sum)

Include a brief key:
5 = Excellent; 4 = Good; 3 = Adequate; 2 = Weak; 1 = Poor.

4) TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS (60–90 words each)
For each ranked concept:
- Why This Concept: [Connect to PRIMARY GOAL and constraints]
- Key Risks: [2–3 specific risks]
- Mitigations: [Concrete steps for each risk]
- Quick Win Potential: [How to pilot or test fast/cheap]

5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT
Potential Partners/Hosts:
- Venues aligned with [CITY/REGION] and concepts
- Community orgs from [CAUSE/COMMUNITY PARTNERS] or related to [MISSION/CAUSE]
- Media partners and in-kind sources

Talent/MC Ideas:
- 3–5 specific suggestions (local leaders, mission-aligned influencers, beneficiaries) relevant to [TARGET AUDIENCE] and [CAUSE/COMMUNITY PARTNERS]

Sponsorship Hooks:
- Naming tiers (e.g., Presenting, Impact, Community Champion)
- Sponsored segments (e.g., Welcome Reception, Mission Moment, Accessibility Sponsor)
- Tangible assets (stage branding, digital/print assets, swag, matching gifts)

Beneficiary/Volunteer Involvement:
- Authentic roles for program participants (storytelling, demos, advisory input)
- Meaningful volunteer roles beyond logistics (host committees, peer fundraisers)

6) NEXT STEPS & DECISION TIMELINE
- Quick-Win Pilots: [1–2 small tests; e.g., mini version with board/champions]
- Validation Plan: [Surveys, brief calls, focus groups—list 4–6 key questions]
- Decision Timeline: [Week 1–2 input; Week 3 decision; Week 4 kickoff]
- 90-Day Pre-Approval Tasks: [Venue holds, budget model, sponsor prospecting list + packages, staffing/volunteer plan, accessibility plan, risk/contingency, initial marketing timeline]

FORMATTING & TONE
- Length: 1,200–1,800 words total
- Tone: Use selected [TONE] (choose ONE: FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL)
- Style: Scannable headers, bullet points, bold for key terms; clear, concrete language
- Voice: Mission-focused, practical, energizing; skip jargon

Author Line
Prepared by [NAME/TITLE] for [AUDIENCE] on [DATE]

PRIORITIZATION GUIDANCE FOR AI
When constraints conflict, prioritize unless user specifies otherwise:
1) Accessibility and inclusion (non-negotiable—address [ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS])
2) Capacity feasibility (respect [STAFF CAPACITY] and [BUDGET RANGE])
3) Net revenue potential (align with [NET REVENUE TARGET])
4) Creative differentiation (stand out from [DIFFERENTIATORS/NEARBY EVENTS])
5) Audience appeal (resonate with [TARGET AUDIENCE])
If inputs are unclear, make reasonable assumptions and note them.
