## Pro Tips

1. **Plan ahead**: GivingTuesday emails should be written and scheduled weeks in advance
2. **Send early**: Best time is 6-8am in donors' time zones (catch them before inbox floods)
3. **Multiple touches**: Plan for morning email, midday social post, evening reminder
4. **Mobile-first**: Most GivingTuesday donations happen on phones - optimize for mobile
5. **Social proof**: Share progress updates throughout day ("We're at 60% of our goal!")
6. **Easy sharing**: Pre-write social posts donors can copy/paste to share
7. **Matching gifts work**: If you can secure a match, promote it heavily
8. **Thank immediately**: Auto-responder thank-you email sent instantly after donation
