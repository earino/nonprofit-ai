## The Prompt

```
Create a one-page Grant Prospect Research Summary for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to decide whether to pursue a foundation prospect quickly and confidently.

The Grant Prospect Research Summary should:
- Follow this order: 1) Funder Snapshot, 2) Fit to [PROGRAM/PROJECT] in [GEOGRAPHY], 3) Giving Patterns, 4) Eligibility, 5) Application & Deadlines, 6) Typical Award Size, 7) Recent Similar Grantees, 8) Relationships, 9) Risks/Flags, 10) Decision & Next Steps.
- Funder Snapshot: name, EIN, website, mission (direct quote ≤20 words), priority areas, geography served, assets and annual giving (latest available).
- Fit: 1–2 sentences mapping funder interests to [PROGRAM/PROJECT], [BENEFICIARY POPULATION], and any [EQUITY PRIORITIES].
- Giving Patterns: typical/median size, multi-year? renewals? general operating vs program? first-time grantee openness.
- Eligibility: 501(c)(3) required? fiscal sponsor allowed? invite-only? exclusions.
- Application & Deadlines: LOI/full? portal? cycle and next due date(s); recommended lead time.
- Recent Similar Grantees: list 3–5 with year and amount (note source: 990, website, press).
- Relationships: known connections (board/staff/alumni), potential warm intro paths (e.g., LinkedIn), and cultivation ideas.
- Success Likelihood: 1–5 rating with one-sentence rationale; recommended ask [FUNDING RANGE SOUGHT]; level of effort (estimated hours).
- Risks/Flags: invite-only, narrow geography, issue misalignment, low payout history, long timelines—name specifics.
- Decision: Pursue / Monitor / Skip with one-sentence reason and 2–3 concrete next steps.
- Cite sources used: [RESEARCH SOURCES/LINKS]. Mark unknowns “Unknown” and list 2–3 follow-up research questions.
- Length: 220–280 words. Tone [TONE]: FORMAL (board/CEO-ready), WARM (internal staff), CASUAL (quick notes). Prepared by [PREPARER NAME/TITLE], [DATE].

Aim for specific, verifiable facts (numbers, dates, named grantees). Avoid clichés (“great fit”), jargon, or promises. If data is >3 years old, label it “outdated.” Flag invite-only and eligibility deal-breakers early. Keep it scannable so small teams can prioritize high-probability prospects and avoid misaligned proposals.
