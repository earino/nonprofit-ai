## The Prompt

```
BEFORE YOU START: Gather these details to customize your SOP:
- [PROCESS NAME] – e.g., “Monthly Donor Acknowledgment Letters,” “Client Intake and Enrollment”
- [ORGANIZATION NAME] – Your nonprofit’s name
- [PRIMARY ROLE OWNER] – Job title who normally does this, e.g., “Development Coordinator”
- [BACKUP ROLE] – Who covers when primary is out, e.g., “Executive Director,” “Program Assistant”
- [TOOLS/SYSTEMS] – Software/platforms used, e.g., “Salesforce NPSP, Gmail, Google Drive”
- [COMPLIANCE REQS] – Regulations that apply, e.g., “HIPAA,” “FERPA,” “IRS charitable receipt rules,” or “None”
- [STORAGE LOCATION] – Where this SOP will live, e.g., “Google Drive > Operations > SOPs”
- [TONE] – Choose one: FORMAL, WARM, or CASUAL

Draft a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for [PROCESS NAME] at [ORGANIZATION NAME], designed for a small nonprofit team with limited time and budget.

When to use this prompt: Use for recurring processes performed by more than one person, tasks critical to compliance or donor relations, or areas at risk if a single staffer leaves. For one-off or highly variable work, consider a simple checklist instead.

Required SOP Sections:

Essential (include in every SOP):

1) Purpose and Audience (2–3 sentences)
- Why this procedure exists and who will use it (e.g., new staff, volunteers, temp coverage).
- Example: “This SOP ensures all donors receive accurate, timely tax receipts per IRS rules. Used by Development Coordinator; backup: ED.”

2) Scope and Timing
- When it’s triggered, how often performed, expected duration.
- Example: “Triggered within 48 hours of gift entry. Frequency: 2–3x weekly. Duration: 15 min per 10 gifts.”

3) Roles and Coverage
- [PRIMARY ROLE OWNER], [BACKUP ROLE]; include required permissions/access.
- Example: “Requires Salesforce NPSP edit rights and Drive folder access.”

4) Tools and Systems
- List [TOOLS/SYSTEMS] with direct links and brief access steps (e.g., “Log in at app.salesforce.com with @orgname.org”).
- Offer low-cost alternatives if primary tool is down (e.g., “Use Google Sheet template [link] and sync later”).

5) Step-by-Step Instructions (Numbered, 5–15 steps)
- For each step: who does what, where to click/type, fields to complete, time estimate.
- Include decision points (e.g., “If gift > $1,000, notify ED via Slack”).
- Add [Screenshot of ____] placeholders for key screens.
- End with a mini-checklist summarizing critical steps.

6) Definition of Done / Quality Standards
- What must be true before marking complete.
- Example: “✓ Receipt PDF in Drive > Donor Files > [Year]; ✓ CRM ‘Receipt Sent [Date]’ field updated; ✓ Donor tagged ‘Receipt Sent [Year]’.”

Recommended (add as relevant):

7) Troubleshooting (3–7 common issues)
- Use “If X, then Y” fixes; include nonprofit-specific cases.
- Example: “If donor declines a receipt, note in CRM and send thank-you only. If client lacks ID, follow Emergency Enrollment SOP.”

8) Data, Privacy, and Accessibility
- PII handling, retention, and [COMPLIANCE REQS].
- Language access (e.g., Spanish templates available).
- ADA-friendly tips for public-facing materials.

9) Communication Templates/Snippets
- 1–3 short email/script templates as needed.
- Example: “Subject: Your tax receipt from [ORGANIZATION NAME]…”

10) Related Procedures and Escalation
- Link related SOPs (e.g., Gift Entry, Donor Corrections).
- Who to contact for help (name/role/contact method).

Mandatory Footer:

11) Version Control
- Author: [Name]
- Process Owner: [PRIMARY ROLE OWNER]
- Approver: [Name/Title]
- Version: [e.g., 1.0]
- Effective Date: [MM/DD/YYYY]
- Next Review Date: [One year from effective date]
- Storage Location: [STORAGE LOCATION]

12) Signature Lines
Process Owner Approval: ______________________ Date: ________
[PRIMARY ROLE OWNER name/title]

Executive Approval: __________________________ Date: ________
[Approver name/title]

Length: 500–900 words total (adjust for complexity; simple processes may be ~400 words, complex up to 1,000).

Tone: Use [TONE] throughout.
- FORMAL: Policy-oriented, third person; suitable for board/funder review.
- WARM: Supportive, plain language; second person “you”; good for staff/volunteer mix.
- CASUAL: Internal quick-reference; conversational, bullet-heavy.

Quality Guidelines:
- Write concrete, day-one steps a new hire can follow.
- Avoid vague phrases (“ensure quality”), jargon (“leverage,” “utilize”), and mission fluff.
- Use nonprofit-specific, plain language (e.g., “Open Salesforce NPSP”).
- Keep steps scannable; document exceptions and real decision points.
- Include low-cost workarounds and [Screenshot of ____] placeholders.
- Store centrally and date-stamp to reduce single-person knowledge risk.

Output Format: Create as a Google Doc or Word document with clear headers, numbered steps, and space for screenshots. Use tables for checklists or multi-column info if helpful.
