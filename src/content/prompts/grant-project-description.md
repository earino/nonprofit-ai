## The Prompt

```
Draft a funder-ready Grant Project Description/Narrative for [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [PROGRAM NAME] to be submitted to [FUNDER NAME].

The narrative should:
- Use this structure (in order), matching funder headings if provided: 1) Executive Summary; 2) Organizational Capacity; 3) Community Need; 4) Program Design & Logic Model; 5) Implementation Plan & Timeline; 6) Staffing & Partnerships; 7) Equity & Accessibility; 8) Evidence Base & Innovation; 9) Evaluation & Learning; 10) Risks & Mitigation; 11) Budget & Sustainability; 12) Funder Alignment & Compliance; 13) Conclusion.
- Open with a 3–4 sentence summary stating: request of [FUNDING AMOUNT REQUESTED], who is served ([POPULATION]) in [GEOGRAPHY], what changes will occur, and the [FUNDING PERIOD].
- Translate the model into a clear logic chain: Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Short-term Outcomes → Long-term Outcomes; include 3–5 SMART objectives with numeric targets tied to [OUTPUT METRICS] and [OUTCOME METRICS].
- Provide a realistic timeline with monthly/quarterly milestones, responsible roles, and critical dependencies for [FUNDING PERIOD] ([TIMELINE]).
- Describe staffing and partners: roles, FTE/time allocation, qualifications, MOUs, and backup coverage for a lean team ([STAFFING], [PARTNERS]).
- Address equity and accessibility (e.g., language, transportation, eligibility, ADA) and how community voice shaped design ([EQUITY STRATEGIES]).
- Cite 2–4 credible sources supporting the approach ([EVIDENCE/CITATIONS]) and explain how any innovation is a low-risk adaptation with safeguards.
- Detail evaluation: data sources, collection cadence, analysis, feedback loops, and reporting to [FUNDER NAME] ([EVALUATION PLAN], [DATA SOURCES]).
- Name top risks and mitigations; include compliance steps ([RISKS/MITIGATION], [COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS]).
- Summarize budget by category and tie to activities; note match/in-kind and plan to sustain beyond grant ([BUDGET SUMMARY], [SUSTAINABILITY]).
- Length: [WORD COUNT RANGE] (e.g., 800–1,200 words). Tone: [TONE]=FORMAL (precise, neutral, citation-friendly) / WARM (people-centered, plain language) / PERSUASIVE (confident, evidence-grounded).
- End with an attribution line: Prepared by [AUTHOR NAME, TITLE], [DATE].

Write for non-expert reviewers (8th–10th grade readability). Be concrete, numeric, and funder-aligned; mirror [FUNDER NAME] priorities/terms. Avoid clichés (“game-changing”), vague claims, excessive jargon/acronyms (define on first use), and overpromising beyond capacity. Ensure internal consistency across goals, activities, metrics, timeline, and budget.
