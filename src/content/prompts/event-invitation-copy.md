## The Prompt

```
Create event invitation copy for [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [EVENT NAME] that quickly earns calendar commitments and reflects our nonprofit brand and mission.

The invitation copy should:
- Deliver four assets: 1) Full web/print invitation (200–300 words); 2) Email version (100–150 words) with 2–3 subject lines (40–60 chars) and one preheader (70–90 chars); 3) 1–2 line SMS/Slack blurb (120–180 chars); 4) Optional thank-you line for sponsors.
- Open with a clear attendee benefit/hook tied to mission impact or experience: [BENEFIT/HOOK].
- Put the “what/when/where” in the first paragraph: [DATE], [TIME], [VENUE NAME], [ADDRESS/CITY] or [VIRTUAL LINK], [TICKET PRICE/FREE], [RSVP DEADLINE], [REGISTRATION LINK/QR].
- Explain “why attend” in 2–3 concrete specifics: [KEY SPEAKER/MC], [EXPERIENCE ELEMENTS], [IMPACT MOMENT/CLIENT STORY], [NETWORKING VALUE].
- Include a strong CTA: “Register by [DATE] at [LINK].” If relevant, add [EARLY-BIRD/SLIDING SCALE/SPONSOR TABLES].
- Provide logistics: [DRESS CODE], [PARKING/TRANSIT], [ACCESSIBILITY INFO + CONTACT: EMAIL/PHONE], [COVID/HEALTH NOTE if needed].
- Recognize sponsors: “Thanks to [SPONSOR NAMES].” (Leave space for logos.)
- Close with a personal sign-off from [HOST NAME/TITLE] to humanize the invitation and connect to [MISSION IMPACT/GOAL].
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (board/funders; polished, succinct), WARM (donors/community; inviting, appreciative), CASUAL (volunteers/young pros; upbeat, friendly).
- Format for scanning: short paragraphs (1–3 sentences), minimal adjectives, specific nouns and numbers.

Strong copy is specific, brief, and mission-centered without guilt or clichés. Avoid buzzwords (“unprecedented,” “unforgettable”), guilt-laden appeals, or vague promises. Write at a clear 7th–9th grade reading level; use inclusive, welcoming language; limit exclamation points; and ensure the essentials (what/when/where/CTA) are visible in the first 3–4 lines. Output should be ready to paste into email, print, or webpage with minimal edits by a small team.
