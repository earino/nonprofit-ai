## The Prompt

```
Draft a journalist-ready press release announcing the launch of [PROGRAM NAME] by [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The press release should:
- Be 450–550 words; follow AP style; use people-first, plain language; short paragraphs (1–3 sentences); no exclamation points or jargon.
- Use this order: Headline; Optional subhead; “For Immediate Release” or “Embargoed until [EMBARGO DATE/TIME TZ]”; Dateline (CITY, State — Month Day, Year); Lead; Body; Quotes; Call-to-action/assets; Boilerplate; Media contact.
- Write a headline (8–12 words) in active voice that includes [CITY/REGION] or a compelling [LOCAL HOOK]/stat; avoid puns/colons.
- Include release/embargo line and dateline as above.
- Lead paragraph answers who/what/when/where/why/how: name [PROGRAM NAME], [LAUNCH DATE], [LOCATION/ONLINE], [PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES], [PROBLEM STAT], expected change, and scope (serve X people in Y timeframe).
- Body (P2–P3): convert [PROGRAM DETAILS: 3–5 BULLETS] into concise sentences; include [PARTNERS], funding if relevant, and one [SUPPORTING STAT/STATISTIC + SOURCE] with hyperlink; tie to [LOCAL HOOK].
- Quote 1 (25–40 words) from [ED NAME, TITLE] on [ED QUOTE THEME]; specific and human (no “we’re excited”); include one vivid outcome or detail.
- Optional Quote 2 (20–30 words) from [PARTNER SPOKESPERSON] or [BENEFICIARY FIRST NAME—with consent]; respectful, people-first.
- Call to action for media: interview/site visit timing, [CALL TO ACTION], [PHOTO/ASSET LINKS], [WEBSITE URL]; plus a 6–9 word email subject line and a 2–3 sentence pitch tailored to [MEDIA TARGETS].
- Boilerplate (75–100 words): [ONE-SENTENCE MISSION], core programs, geography, annual reach (# served), year founded, website.
- Media contact: [CONTACT NAME], [CONTACT TITLE], [CONTACT EMAIL], [CONTACT PHONE].
- Tone: [TONE = FORMAL (neutral, reporter-ready) / WARM (community-centered, plain) / CONVERSATIONAL (local-friendly, approachable)]; no byline—attribute quotes to speakers.

A strong release is newsy (not promotional), local, and concrete: quantify goals, timelines, and beneficiaries; attribute stats; avoid clichés (“transformative,” “world-class”), acronyms, and savior language. Center community impact and dignity. If any bracketed detail is missing, ask up to three quick clarifying questions before drafting.
