## The Prompt

```
Create [PROFILE COUNT: 3–5] prioritized Board Recruitment Profiles for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to guide strategic, inclusive board recruitment aligned to mission.

The Board Recruitment Profiles should:
- Start with a one-line title and a 1–2 sentence “Why this profile now” tied to [STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR 12–24 MONTHS] and current board gaps.
- Specify “Must-have” and “Nice-to-have” skills and lived experience based on a skills matrix (e.g., finance, legal, HR, fundraising, program/domain expertise), not generic traits.
- State diversity/perspective needs using inclusive, non-tokenizing language; explain why the perspective benefits governance and community accountability.
- Detail responsibilities and realistic time commitment: [MEETING CADENCE], committee(s), prep hours/month, events, and estimated annual hours; note [HYBRID/REMOTE] and [GEOGRAPHY] expectations.
- Clarify fundraising role: explicit [GIVE/GET] (if any), examples of non-monetary fundraising actions (peer introductions, hosting small gatherings, storytelling, advocacy).
- Include governance basics: [TERM LENGTH], onboarding timeline, conflict-of-interest and fiduciary duties, any [LEGAL/FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS].
- Describe support offered: staff liaison, board mentor, training (governance/fundraising), accessibility/accommodations, and how busy professionals can succeed.
- Outline selection criteria and vetting steps: values alignment, references, conflict check, sample screening questions (3–5).
- Suggest 3–6 targeted sourcing avenues: relevant associations, community partners, alumni/affinity groups, volunteer leaders, client/participant leaders (as appropriate).
- Provide a 75–100 word outreach blurb tailored to this profile.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (policy-aligned, precise), WARM (community-centered, inviting), or CASUAL (plain-language, friendly).
- List author/signatory and contact: [AUTHOR: Board Governance Committee/Board Chair/ED], [CONTACT EMAIL]; add “Review by [DATE]” for annual refresh.

Each profile should be 250–350 words plus the outreach blurb and screening questions. Produce clear, concrete expectations; avoid clichés (“rockstar,” “work hard/play hard”), jargon, and tokenizing language. Aim for focus: prioritize what the board truly needs now, be transparent about time and fundraising expectations, and write so a small team can recruit confidently without a search firm.
