## The Prompt

```
Turn [PROGRAM NAME] results from [TIMEFRAME] into an engaging, SEO-ready blog post for [ORGANIZATION NAME] using the notes/data below: [PASTE PROGRAM DATA/NOTES].

The blog post should:
- Open with a 1–2 sentence hook (micro-story or surprising stat) tied to [BENEFICIARY GROUP] in [GEOGRAPHY].
- Include a short beneficiary vignette (3–5 sentences) with one direct quote; use a pseudonym if needed and state [CONSENT STATUS] and how consent was obtained.
- Translate [KEY METRICS] into plain-language insights (what changed, for whom, why it matters); compare to [BASELINE/GOAL] and note any equity considerations.
- Recommend 1–2 visuals we can realistically produce (e.g., simple bar chart from [DATA SOURCE], before/after photo); include captions and accessible alt text.
- Use scannable structure: H1 title, then H2s in this order — The Need, Our Approach, Results in Numbers, Voices from the Program, What’s Next/How You Can Help.
- Length: 650–850 words; short paragraphs (2–4 lines) and bullets where helpful.
- Tone: [TONE] = FORMAL (funder-facing, precise), WARM (community-centered, appreciative), CASUAL (conversational, social-friendly). Stay on-brand for [ORGANIZATION NAME].
- SEO: target [SEO KEYWORDS]; provide a 150–160 character meta description; URL slug; 3–5 internal links (include [DONATE LINK] and relevant program pages) and 1–2 reputable external sources.
- Accessibility and ethics: plain language (grade 8–10), define acronyms, person-first or identity-affirming language per [STYLE GUIDE], no savior framing, exclude sensitive identifiers.
- Calls to action: primary [CALL TO ACTION] plus secondary option(s) (subscribe/volunteer) tailored to [TARGET AUDIENCE].
- Attribution: by [AUTHOR NAME/TITLE]; publish date [PUBLISH DATE]; include fact-check notes and a source list referencing [DATA SOURCE].
- Measurement/repurposing: suggest 3 KPIs (e.g., pageviews, time on page, conversions), a UTM example for links, and 2 social teasers (LinkedIn + Instagram).

Quality: Prioritize specificity over slogans—use concrete numbers (“72% of 148 participants”), name the intervention, and connect data to human impact without exaggeration. Avoid clichés (“making a difference”), jargon, and deficit/savior language. Verify consent and privacy; double-check figures against [DATA SOURCE]. Keep sentences active and varied for readability. Output should be publish-ready with minimal edits by a small team and suitable for monthly cadence and cross-channel reuse.
