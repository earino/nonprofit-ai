## The Prompt

```
Create a donor-centered monthly giving appeal for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to convert recent one-time donors into sustainers.

The monthly giving appeal should:
- Be written for recent one-time donors in [CITY/COMMUNITY] who support [MISSION/CAUSE]
- Deliver: 3 subject lines, 1 preview text (60–90 chars), and a 300–400 word body
- Structure the body in this order: (1) Hook tied to [CURRENT NEED/SEASON]; (2) Why monthly matters for steady services; (3) Suggested monthly amounts [SUGGESTED AMOUNTS: e.g., 15/25/35] with a coffee comparison (e.g., “about [COFFEE COST]”); (4) Annual impact math for each amount using [IMPACT METRIC/UNIT COST EXAMPLES]; (5) Flexibility (“change or cancel anytime”); (6) Address “I already gave” graciously; (7) Benefits of joining [SUSTAINER PROGRAM NAME] ([BENEFITS LIST]); (8) 1–2 sentence donor quote: [DONOR TESTIMONIAL SNIPPET]; (9) Clear CTA line + button copy options (2–3) linking to [LINK]; (10) P.S. that reinforces ease/impact
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (professional, concise), WARM (friendly, grateful), or CASUAL (conversational, upbeat)
- Write at a 6th–8th grade reading level; 1–2 sentence paragraphs; a few skimmable bullets
- Emphasize reliability of monthly gifts (e.g., “keeps lights on, staff scheduled, clients served”)
- Include optional fee note: invite ACH/bank transfer; offer “add $1–$2 to cover fees—totally optional”
- Be donor-centered (“you”), concrete (name [PROGRAM EXAMPLE], cite [IMPACT METRIC]), and specific about outcomes this month
- End with sign-off: [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE], and a reply-to line for questions

Aim for specificity, warmth, and clarity. Avoid jargon, guilt, crisis-only framing, or comparisons that disparage other services. Do not overpromise. Keep the monthly ask manageable, show annual impact math, and make flexibility explicit. The copy should be usable as both an email and donation page intro with minimal edits.
