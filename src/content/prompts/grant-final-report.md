## The Prompt

```
Draft a funder-ready grant final report for [FUNDER NAME] about [GRANT TITLE] by [ORGANIZATION NAME], covering [GRANT PERIOD] and [AMOUNT].

The grant final report should:
- Follow this section order: 1) Thank you/Context; 2) Executive Summary; 3) Objectives & Results; 4) Implementation & Partnerships; 5) Challenges & Lessons Learned; 6) Beneficiary Voice & Equity; 7) Financial Summary; 8) Compliance with [FUNDER NAME] questions; 9) Next Steps/Renewal; 10) Sign-off/Contact.
- Objectives & Results: include an ASCII table (Objective | Target | Actual | Variance %) plus a text alternative for portals; add 1–2 sentences explaining any variance >10% and why it occurred.
- Beneficiary Voice & Equity: provide one concise story (80–120 words) with a direct quote [BENEFICIARY QUOTE], and note who benefited ([GEOGRAPHY/POPULATION], key demographics), including unexpected outcomes (positive or mixed).
- Implementation & Partnerships: 3–5 bullets on what was delivered, when, by whom, and notable collaborators.
- Challenges & Lessons Learned: be candid yet constructive—what changed mid-course, mitigations taken, and how learning will inform future work.
- Financial Summary: align to approved budget categories [BUDGET CATEGORIES]; show Grant Funds Spent, Other Funds/In-kind, Total; explain any category variance >10% and any cost savings or leverage.
- Compliance: directly answer [FUNDER QUESTIONS/PORTAL LIMITS]; mirror funder terminology; provide plain-text versions if tables aren’t allowed.
- Next Steps/Renewal: what continues, remaining need [$], and a respectful invitation for renewed/continued partnership.
- Data integrity: use only provided data; if missing, insert [DATA NEEDED: source] and a suggested retrieval note; list data sources.
- Clarity: write at an 8th–10th grade level; define acronyms on first use; avoid clichés and over-claims.
- Length: [WORD COUNT RANGE: e.g., 700–1,000 words] total narrative.
- Tone: [FORMAL = precise/compliance-first], [WARM = professional, relational, grateful], or [CASUAL = plainspoken/community].
- Sign-off: [SIGNATORY NAME, TITLE, EMAIL, PHONE].

Quality matters: be specific, consistent, and transparent. Match numbers in narrative and financials; keep names/totals consistent with the original grant. Avoid jargon (“impactful,” “leverage” without specifics), hype, or crisis language. Balance honesty about challenges with clear corrective actions and gratitude to [FUNDER NAME].
