## The Prompt

```
Write a compassionate, respectful thank-you letter for a donor who gave $[AMOUNT]
to [ORGANIZATION NAME] in [HONOR/MEMORY] of [HONOREE NAME]. The letter should:

- Express gratitude for the gift while acknowledging the significance of honoring someone
- Use appropriate, sensitive language for [MEMORIAL/TRIBUTE] context
- Explain how the gift will create meaningful impact in [HONOREE NAME]'s name
- Mention that [HONOREE FAMILY NAME/PERSON] will be notified of the gift (but not the amount)
- Include the specific program or fund: [PROGRAM/FUND NAME]
- Offer to send acknowledgment card to family if desired
- Be respectful, warm, and sincere without being overly emotional
- Be 200-300 words
- Use a [COMPASSIONATE/RESPECTFUL/WARM] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should honor both the donor's generosity and the person being remembered
or celebrated. Strike a balance between gratitude and sensitivity to loss or
celebration. Avoid platitudes or overly religious language unless you know the donor.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[AMOUNT]** with the gift amount
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[HONOR/MEMORY]** with either "honor" or "memory"
4. Replace **[HONOREE NAME]** with the person being honored/remembered
5. Replace **[MEMORIAL/TRIBUTE]** with appropriate term
6. Replace **[HONOREE FAMILY NAME/PERSON]** with who will be notified (e.g., "the Smith family" or "Mrs. Johnson")
7. Replace **[PROGRAM/FUND NAME]** with what the gift supports
8. Replace **[COMPASSIONATE/RESPECTFUL/WARM]** with your tone preference
9. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign

## Pro Tips

1. **Send two letters**: One to donor, one to family being honored (family letter doesn't mention amount)
2. **Timeline**: Send promptly, especially for memorial gifts during grief period
3. **Keep it simple**: Avoid flowery language or religious references unless you know the family
4. **Offer options**: Let donor know if they want family to receive notification or card
5. **Follow up**: Memorial/tribute donors often become recurring supporters - steward them well
6. **Be specific**: Mention how the gift honors the person's values or connection to your cause
7. **Permanent recognition**: If you have memorial wall/website, mention they'll be included
