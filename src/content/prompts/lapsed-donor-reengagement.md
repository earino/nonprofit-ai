## The Prompt

```
Write a warm, non-pressuring email to re-engage a donor who last gave [TIME PERIOD]
ago to [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Acknowledge the time since their last gift warmly, without guilt or blame
- Express that they're missed and their support mattered
- Provide a brief, compelling update on what's happened since they last gave
- Reference their last gift: [LAST GIFT DETAILS]
- Share one exciting development or recent win they'd care about
- Make it easy for them to reconnect with a simple, low-barrier ask
- Offer multiple ways to re-engage: [donate/volunteer/attend event/take survey/just stay in touch]
- Emphasize "we'd love to have you back" not "we need your money"
- Be 150-250 words (shorter than normal - respect their time)
- Use a [WARM/FRIENDLY/CASUAL] tone
- End with genuine invitation to reply
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The email should acknowledge the relationship lapse without making the donor feel
bad, focus on progress and impact, and provide an easy, pressure-free path back
to engagement.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[TIME PERIOD]** with duration (e.g., "18 months" or "in early 2024")
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[LAST GIFT DETAILS]** with their previous donation (e.g., "your $100 gift to our Youth Program")
4. Add **specific update** since their last gift (program milestone, people served, new initiative)
5. Replace **[donate/volunteer/attend event/etc.]** with your chosen re-engagement path
6. Replace **[WARM/FRIENDLY/CASUAL]** with appropriate tone
7. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign
8. Consider adding personal touch if you know why they lapsed

## Pro Tips

1. **Timing matters**: 12-18 months is ideal - too soon feels pushy, too late feels forgotten
2. **Subject line is critical**: Avoid "We miss you!" or "Come back" - try "Quick update from [ORG]" or "[First Name], thought you'd want to know..."
3. **No guilt**: Never say "we haven't heard from you" or "you stopped supporting us"
4. **Focus forward**: More about what's happening now than dwelling on the gap
5. **Easy first step**: Don't immediately ask for money - offer survey, event invite, or just "reply to say hi"
6. **Segment wisely**: Different approaches for different lapse reasons if you know them
7. **Test subject lines**: A/B test to find what resonates with your lapsed segments
