## The Prompt

```
You are a nonprofit strategy consultant specializing in Theory of Change development. Draft a clear, evidence-based Theory of Change narrative that explains how and why change will happen through this program.

REQUIRED INPUTS (fill all bracketed fields before running)
Program & Organization:
- [PROGRAM NAME]
- [ORGANIZATION NAME]
- [TARGET POPULATION] (be specific: age, demographics, circumstances)
- [GEOGRAPHY] (neighborhood, city, region, or service area)

Audience, Tone, and Length:
- [AUDIENCE: FUNDERS / BOARD / STAFF / PARTNERS]
- [TONE: FORMAL (grant-ready) / WARM (community-facing) / CASUAL (internal draft)]
- [LENGTH: STANDARD (800–1,200 words) / SHORT (500–800 words)]

Evidence & Context:
- [EVIDENCE SOURCES/LOCAL DATA] (name 2–4 specific sources you will cite in plain language; e.g., “2024 County Health Rankings; 2023 ACS/Census; City DHS homelessness dashboard; our 2024 community listening sessions; peer-reviewed meta-analysis on mentoring”)
- [KEY PARTNERS] (list 2–3 organizations or agencies and their roles)

Team Capacity:
- [TEAM SIZE] (number of staff who will implement and track this)
- [DATA CAPACITY/BUDGET CONSTRAINTS] (e.g., “limited—no evaluator,” “moderate—annual survey budget,” “strong—evaluation staff”)

Document Control:
- [VERSION NUMBER] (e.g., V1.0, V2.3)
- [AUTHOR/TITLE]
- [DATE]

OUTPUT STRUCTURE
Deliver a narrative organized as follows. Use short sentences, plain language (8th–10th grade), and concrete numbers/timeframes.

1) Header & Impact Statement (≈50 words)
- Title, [VERSION NUMBER], [DATE], [AUTHOR/TITLE]
- One-sentence ultimate impact that names [TARGET POPULATION] and the change in [GEOGRAPHY]
Example: “Young adults ages 16–24 in Eastview secure stable jobs and income growth within five years, reducing youth unemployment in Eastview.”

2) Problem & Root Causes (STANDARD: 150–200 words; SHORT: 100–150 words)
- Concise problem statement with 2–3 data points from [EVIDENCE SOURCES/LOCAL DATA]
- 2–3 root causes, including structural inequities (policy barriers, discrimination, access gaps)
- Why the problem persists locally
Preferred evidence types: Census/ACS; County Health Rankings; CDC/state department datasets; school district or HMIS/admin data; local needs assessments; peer-reviewed studies; community listening sessions or focus groups.

3) Pathway of Change (STANDARD: 400–500 words; SHORT: 250–350 words)
Map the if-then logic clearly:
Activities (what we do) →
Outputs (what we produce) →
Short-term outcomes (6–12 months: knowledge/skills/attitudes) →
Intermediate outcomes (1–3 years: behaviors/practices/systems) →
Long-term outcomes (3–5+ years: conditions) →
Impact (population-level change)

For each link:
- Make the causal connection explicit: “If we do X, then Y will happen because…”
- Name the key assumption(s) that must hold true
- Give brief rationale from research or practice experience
- Use specific, measurable language with timeframes
Example of one link:
“If youth complete 40 hours of paid work experience with weekly coaching (activity), then 80% will show gains on a soft-skills rubric within 6 months (output/outcome). Assumes supervisors use youth-friendly practices and provide real tasks. Our last three cohorts showed 75% gains under these conditions, and a 2022 meta-analysis of work-based learning found similar effects.”

4) Preconditions & External Factors (STANDARD: 100–150 words; SHORT: 75–100 words)
- Preconditions for success (e.g., stable funding, partner MoUs, referral pipelines, safe space, tech access)
- What is within program control vs. external systems (policy, housing market, labor demand)
- How you will monitor or adapt to factors you cannot control

5) Attribution & Partnership (STANDARD: 100–150 words; SHORT: 75–100 words)
- [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s specific role and what you can credibly claim
- How [KEY PARTNERS] contribute to specific links in the pathway
- What outcomes require collective effort and how joint work influences systems

6) Risks & Mitigation (STANDARD: 100–150 words; SHORT: 75–100 words)
- 3–4 realistic barriers (e.g., participant retention, staff turnover, transportation, policy shifts)
- Mitigation strategies for each, noting equity steps (language access, stipends, childcare, trauma-informed practices)
- How beneficiary voice shapes adaptations (surveys, advisory group, feedback loops)

7) Learning & Measurement (STANDARD: 150–200 words; SHORT: 100–150 words)
- Indicators: 2–4 practical measures for each outcome level (short/intermediate/long-term). Keep feasible for [TEAM SIZE] and [DATA CAPACITY/BUDGET CONSTRAINTS].
- Key learning questions (3–4)
- Data sources (surveys, observations, administrative data, partner reports, focus groups)
- Frequency (e.g., monthly output review; quarterly outcome check; annual partner debrief)
- Use: how you will act on findings (program tweaks, staff training, partner escalation)

8) Boundaries & Sustainability (STANDARD: 50–100 words; SHORT: 40–75 words)
- What the program will NOT do (scope limits)
- Core assumptions for financial and operational sustainability
- What must change in the ecosystem for impact to last beyond direct services
- Signature block: [AUTHOR/TITLE], [DATE]

9) Visual Diagram Outline (separate section; 6–8 elements)
Create a text-based flowchart that a non-designer can sketch:
- List “Box X: [Label]” in order from Problem → Activities → Outputs → Short-term → Intermediate → Long-term → Impact
- Use arrows (↓) to show flow
- Bracket assumptions next to the arrow that depends on them
- Note external factors on the side of the relevant arrow or box
Example:
Box 1: Problem (youth unemployment 22% in Eastview)
↓
Box 2: Activities (paid internships + weekly coaching)
↓ [Assumption: employers provide meaningful tasks; supervisors trained]
Box 3: Short-term (soft skills; resume readiness within 6–12 months)
↓
Box 4: Intermediate (job placement or college enrollment within 1–2 years)
[External factor: local job market]
↓
Box 5: Long-term (stable earnings 3–5+ years)
↓
Box 6: Impact (reduced youth unemployment in Eastview)

QUALITY STANDARDS
Required:
- Use concrete numbers, percentages, and timeframes
- Write at 8th–10th grade reading level; plain language; short sentences
- Make each if-then link plausible and specific; state assumptions and rationale
- Ground claims in accessible evidence or transparent practice wisdom
- Keep indicators and data collection realistic for [TEAM SIZE] and [DATA CAPACITY/BUDGET CONSTRAINTS]
Avoid:
- Jargon/clichés: “empower,” “move the needle,” “capacity building” (without definition)
- Over-claiming impact you cannot attribute
- Vague verbs (“increase,” “improve”) without a baseline, target, and timeframe
- Dense academic citations; reference sources in plain language

SUGGESTED INDICATOR MENU (adapt to your program)
- Outputs: # enrolled; % completing core activities; # partner placements; attendance hours
- Short-term: % with skill gains (pre/post); % reporting confidence/knowledge; % with completed plans
- Intermediate: % with behavior change (e.g., job search actions); retention rates; system changes (policy adoption)
- Long-term: % with sustained outcomes (e.g., 12-month job retention); condition changes (e.g., housing stability)
- Impact (contribution): population-level trend lines; comparative rates vs. city/county; partner system metrics

FINAL CHECKLIST
- All [BRACKETED FIELDS] replaced with specifics (or “TBD” flagged)
- Word count matches [LENGTH]
- Every link includes an assumption and brief rationale
- Each outcome level has 2–4 measurable indicators
- Risks include equity considerations and mitigation
- Learning plan fits [TEAM SIZE] and [DATA CAPACITY/BUDGET CONSTRAINTS]
- Reading level is accessible; jargon removed
- Diagram outline is simple enough to sketch by hand
- Version control and signature included

Why this is a Theory of Change, not a Logic Model:
This narrative explains how and why change happens (causal links, assumptions, context, external factors), not just what you do. It makes your theory testable so you can learn, adapt, and improve results over time.
