## The Prompt

```
Create a social media post for [AWARENESS DAY NAME] on [DATE] for [ORGANIZATION NAME], directly tied to our work in [MISSION AREA/ISSUE] and audience [AUDIENCE], to publish on [PRIMARY PLATFORM].

The post should:
- Follow this structure: 1) concise hook naming the day and why it matters; 2) what we do about it (program or service); 3) 1 proof point ([IMPACT PROOF] or [PROGRAM EXAMPLE]); 4) clear action with link [RESOURCE/LINK].
- Be 80-120 words, plain language (6th–8th grade), active voice.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (policy/funder-facing, precise, respectful), WARM (community-centered, invitational, hopeful), or CASUAL (friendly, conversational, emoji-light).
- Include hashtags: [OFFICIAL HASHTAG], [ORGANIZATION HASHTAG], plus 1–2 niche/specific tags [NICHE HASHTAG 1-2]; avoid generic overcrowded tags beyond these.
- Localize the post with [LOCAL/COMMUNITY ANGLE] and/or tag a relevant partner [PARTNER HANDLE OPTIONAL] if collaboration is real.
- Specify a realistic original visual we can produce quickly (e.g., staff/participant photo with consent, simple stat graphic, program-in-action shot). Avoid trauma or exploitative imagery.
- Provide image ALT TEXT (120–150 characters) that is respectful, people-first, and descriptive.
- Include a posting time window (6–8 a.m. local) and note if time-sensitive content warrants earlier scheduling.
- Add one prewritten moderator reply (1 sentence) to common comments/questions and any needed content warning.
- If we do not have genuine relevance to this day, recommend skipping or suggest a more aligned observance.
- Optional: add [SIGN-OFF OPTIONAL] if the platform/style calls for attribution.

Quality principles: Be specific and authentic—show what we are doing, not just “raising awareness.” Avoid clichés (“we stand with,” “join the fight”), jargon, savior framing, or trauma details. Prioritize dignity-first language, concrete actions, and a link that delivers value (guide, resource, volunteer shift, donation form).
