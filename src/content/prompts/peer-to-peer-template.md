## The Prompt

```
Create peer-to-peer fundraising message templates that volunteers can quickly personalize to invite their networks to donate to [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [CAMPAIGN/EVENT].

The templates should:
- Provide 4 versions: (1) Email 180-220 words, (2) Text/DM 45-80 words, (3) Facebook/Instagram post 90-140 words with a simple image idea, (4) LinkedIn post 120-180 words.
- Follow this order in each: (1) Why I’m involved (1-2 sentences), (2) 1-line org intro/what it does, (3) Specific impact ask with dollar handle ([IMPACT: $X = Y]), (4) Clear link early and again near the end, (5) Deadline/urgency, (6) Thanks + easy way to share.
- Use [BRACKETED] prompts volunteers can fill in: [YOUR NAME], [RELATIONSHIP/WHY I’M INVOLVED – 1-2 sentences], [ORGANIZATION NAME], [PROGRAM/CAUSE], [IMPACT: $X = Y], [GOAL AMOUNT], [DEADLINE DATE], [MATCH INFO optional], [FUNDRAISING PAGE LINK – short], [CITY/COMMUNITY], [PHOTO ALT-TEXT], [PRONOUNS optional].
- Include 3 email subject lines (5-7 words each) and 3 text/DM openers.
- Add a P.S. line in the email that restates the impact and link.
- Include one follow-up/reminder message (60-100 words) and one thank-you/acknowledgment message (60-100 words) volunteers can send after gifts.
- Tone options [TONE]: FORMAL (board/corporate—no emojis, full words), WARM (friends/family—friendly, 0-1 emoji), CASUAL (peers/social—conversational, 0-2 emojis). Apply consistently across versions.
- Keep language concrete and human; use short sentences/paragraphs; scannable bullets OK in email.
- Offer non-donation support option: [SHARE/ATTEND/LEARN MORE LINK].
- Add optional compliance line: “[ORGANIZATION NAME] is a [501(c)(3) STATUS]; gifts may be tax-deductible. [TAX ID optional].”
- Sign-offs: [YOUR NAME], [RELATIONSHIP TO ORG], [CITY], [PRONOUNS optional].

Quality: Be specific (one clear $ ask and impact), people-first, and mobile-friendly. Avoid clichés (“now more than ever”), guilt/shame, acronyms/jargon, walls of text, or multiple competing CTAs. The final copy should be paste-ready with visible [BRACKETS] and a working link near the top.
