## The Prompt

```
Create a monthly program-update email newsletter for [ORGANIZATION NAME], focused on [ISSUE/COMMUNITY] and the period [MONTH/QUARTER/YEAR].

The newsletter should:
- Be 400–600 words, mobile-first, scannable; use short paragraphs (2–3 sentences), bullets, and headers under 5 words.
- Follow this order (4 sections): 1) Program highlight with 1–2 concrete metrics and a 2–3 sentence beneficiary vignette; 2) Upcoming events (dates, 1-line purpose, simple RSVP link); 3) Donor/volunteer spotlight with a gratitude note; 4) Clear primary CTA [DONATE/VOLUNTEER/REGISTER] plus one secondary action.
- Include 3 specific subject lines (45–65 chars), 1 preheader (35–70 chars), and preview snippet (20–30 words); avoid generic phrases like “Monthly Newsletter.”
- Open and close with a personal note from [SIGNER NAME, TITLE: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR/PROGRAM MANAGER]; include a short P.S. that tees up the CTA without hard pressure.
- Place 1–2 photo placeholders with captions and meaningful ALT text; suggest easy-to-source images from [PROGRAM NAME/RECENT EVENT].
- Write for mixed audiences (donors, volunteers, partners); add two segmented P.S. variants: [DONOR P.S.] and [VOLUNTEER P.S.].
- Use accessibility and clarity best practices: descriptive link text, plain-text fallback, and 8th–10th grade reading level; define acronyms once.
- Balance stewardship vs ask at roughly 80/20; center impact and gratitude.
- Add footer placeholders: contact info, manage preferences link (“update email frequency”), and compliance language.
- Track results: apply [UTM CAMPAIGN] to all links; list 3 KPIs beyond opens (e.g., CTR, event RSVPs, donation page views) and 1 A/B test idea (e.g., subject specificity vs. impact stat).
- Recommend a send cadence [MONTHLY/QUARTERLY] and best send window for [AUDIENCE TIMEZONE].
- Tone: [TONE]= FORMAL (board/funders, precise, reserved), WARM (donors/partners, relational, encouraging), CASUAL (volunteers/community, friendly, energetic). Apply consistently.

Quality: Be concrete, local, and human-centered; avoid clichés, guilt language, and heavy jargon. Protect dignity and privacy (first names/consent if used). The goal is steady stewardship that sets up future asks and reduces unsubscribes through value-first content.
