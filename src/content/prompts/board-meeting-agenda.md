## The Prompt

```
Draft a concise, board-ready agenda for [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [QUARTERLY/MONTHLY/SPECIAL] Board Meeting on [MEETING DATE] ([IN-PERSON/VIRTUAL/HYBRID] at [LOCATION/ZOOM LINK], [TIME ZONE]).

The agenda should:
- Fit on one page (agenda body 250–350 words) and open with logistics: date/time, location/link, RSVP, accessibility note ([ACCESS NEEDS CONTACT]), and meeting length [MEETING LENGTH].
- List sections in this order: 1) Call to Order & Mission Moment (2–3 min), 2) Consent Agenda, 3) Strategic Discussion (primary), 4) Brief Operational Updates, 5) Committee Items (only if decision needed), 6) Finance/Fiduciary, 7) Governance/Board Development, 8) Executive Session (if needed), 9) Action Recap & Adjourn.
- For each item include: time allotment, presenter, desired outcome [VOTE/DISCUSS/FYI], and pre-read title/link (pre-reads sent by [PREREAD DATE]).
- Use a Consent Agenda for routine items (e.g., prior minutes, ED report, routine contracts under [$THRESHOLD]); note “Members may pull items for discussion.”
- Put Strategic Discussion first (e.g., “[STRATEGIC TOPIC]”) with 2–3 guiding questions and a clear decision or next-step output.
- Clearly mark motions requiring approval (e.g., “Motion: Approve Q2 Financials”) with estimated time and who introduces the motion.
- Time-box all reports to minimize “read-outs;” prioritize dialogue; ensure 50–60% of total time is strategic.
- If [MEETING LENGTH] > 120 minutes, insert a 5-minute break and include a brief stretch or check-in.
- Name roles: Facilitator, Timekeeper, and Note-taker; specify who tracks the parking lot and action items.
- Close with Action Recap (owner + deadline) and Next Meeting date.
- Tone: [FORMAL (board governance emphasis)/WARM (collaborative and mission-focused)/CASUAL (small team, informal culture)].
- Footer: Prepared by [ED NAME] and [BOARD CHAIR NAME]; Questions: [GOVERNANCE CONTACT].

Aim for clarity and brevity; avoid jargon, long reports, or items without a defined outcome. Follow Robert’s Rules loosely (motions/seconds recorded) while keeping engagement high. Use this agenda when you need balanced governance, clear decisions, and respect for volunteers’ time.
