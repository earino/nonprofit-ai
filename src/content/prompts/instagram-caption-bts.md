## The Prompt

```
Write an Instagram behind-the-scenes caption for a nonprofit that humanizes your organization and drives authentic engagement.

REQUIRED INPUTS (fill these in):
- [ORGANIZATION NAME]
- [MISSION IN 1 LINE]
- [PHOTO DESCRIPTION] — what’s literally visible in the image
- [WHO IS IN PHOTO] + [CONSENT STATUS: approved/not approved/no people]
- [GOAL FOR POST: awareness/engagement/volunteer recruitment/donations/education]

OPTIONAL INPUTS (defaults used if skipped):
- [PROGRAM/PROJECT] (default: general org work)
- [LOCATION] (city/region; default: org’s main location)
- [IS CAROUSEL: YES/NO] (default: NO)
- [CTA] (default: AI suggests based on goal)
- [HASHTAG THEMES] (default: derived from mission)
- [STAFF/PARTNER TAGS] (default: none)
- [SENSITIVE DETAILS TO OMIT] (default: no minors’ full names; no restricted info)
- [EMOJI POLICY: NONE/LIGHT (1–2)/PLAYFUL (3–5)] (default: LIGHT)
- [TONE: FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL] (default: WARM)

CAPTION STRUCTURE:

1) HOOK (3–8 words)
- Spark curiosity using a detail from [PHOTO DESCRIPTION]
- Avoid clickbait or questions you don’t answer
- Example: "This whiteboard holds 47 ideas" or "Meet the 6am crew"

2) BODY (40–80 words)
- Micro-story formula:
  • What’s happening: describe the action/moment in the photo
  • Why it matters: connect to [MISSION IN 1 LINE] or community impact
  • Concrete detail: one sensory element from [PHOTO DESCRIPTION] (sound, object, quote, expression, small win)
- Use 1–2 line breaks for mobile readability
- Consent-first: Use first names/roles only if [CONSENT STATUS]=approved; no minors’ full names. If not approved, avoid identifying details and write in group/general terms.
- If the image is simple, highlight a small win or sensory detail.

3) IF [IS CAROUSEL]=YES
- Add after the body (before CTA): "Swipe to see [what slide 2 shows] and [what slide 3 shows]" (be specific)
- This line does NOT count toward the 40–80 word body limit

4) CALL-TO-ACTION
- Align to [GOAL FOR POST]. If [CTA] is provided, use it. Otherwise choose one:
  • Awareness: "What surprised you most?"
  • Engagement: "Have you experienced this too?"
  • Volunteer recruitment: "Volunteer info in bio—join us!"
  • Donations: "Link in bio to support this work."
  • Education: "What questions do you have for our team?"

5) HASHTAGS (5–8 total)
- Mix:
  • 2 cause-related (e.g., #FoodJustice #YouthMentalHealth)
  • 2 location-specific (e.g., #PhillyNonprofit #BayAreaVolunteers)
  • 1–2 community/identity (e.g., #NonprofitLife #SocialWorkersOfIG)
  • 1–2 campaign-specific if applicable (e.g., #GivingTuesday #VolunteerWeek)
- Prioritize specificity over popularity; avoid generic #Nonprofit #Charity unless truly needed

6) TAGGING
- In-caption: Tag up to 2 handles from [STAFF/PARTNER TAGS] only if [CONSENT STATUS]=approved
- Note separately: "Also tag in photo: [handles]" if applicable
- If consent not approved or no people in photo: do not tag individuals

7) ACCESSIBILITY: ALT TEXT
- Write 120–200 characters describing:
  • Who: roles/activities (not names unless public figures)
  • Where: setting/environment
  • What: key actions/objects
- Describe what’s visible; avoid value judgments

8) SUGGESTED POST TIME
- Recommend 11am–1pm or 7–9pm in [LOCATION]’s time zone (infer from [LOCATION]; if missing, use org’s main location)
- Briefly explain why this window fits the audience and [GOAL FOR POST] for this content

OUTPUT ORDER:
1. Hook line
2. Body (with 1–2 line breaks)
3. Carousel swipe line (only if [IS CAROUSEL]=YES)
4. CTA/Question
5. Hashtags
6. Handles to tag (in-caption + in-photo)
7. Alt text
8. Suggested post time + rationale

TONE GUIDE:
- FORMAL: Clear, professional, 0–1 emoji. For funders/partners or sensitive topics.
- WARM: Neighborly, appreciative, 1–2 emojis. Default nonprofit voice—approachable and credible.
- CASUAL: Playful, youth-friendly, 3–5 emojis; light slang OK. For peer audiences or informal programs.

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Savior language ("giving them a voice," "saving," "helping the less fortunate")
- Clichés ("changing the world," "making a difference" without specifics)
- Jargon or acronyms without context
- Clickbait hooks that don’t deliver
- Any info from [SENSITIVE DETAILS TO OMIT]; no minors’ full names
- Corporate/salesy tone—keep it mission- and community-centered
- Individual staff sign-offs—voice represents [ORGANIZATION NAME]

CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
- If [PHOTO DESCRIPTION] and [GOAL FOR POST] don’t align (e.g., candid volunteer laughter vs. donation ask), prioritize authentic storytelling and adjust the CTA to engagement/awareness. Add a note if needed: "This image may perform better for engagement; for a donation ask, pair a direct impact photo or testimonial."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Hook: This is what 4am looks like

Body:
Our street outreach team starts before sunrise, when the city's quietest and conversations happen easier.

This morning, Maria (our peer navigator) connected two people to shelter beds and shared 14 warm meals. The thermoses in this photo? Donated by a local café owner who believes everyone deserves hot coffee. ☕

CTA: Have questions about street outreach? Drop them below.

Hashtags: #StreetOutreach #PhillyHomeless #HarmReduction #PeerSupport #CommunityFirst #SocialWorkersOfInstagram

Handles to tag:
In caption: @peersupportnetwork
Also tag in photo: @mariapeersupport (with consent)

Alt text: Street outreach worker in a winter jacket holds two thermoses beside a supply cart at dawn on a quiet city street; buildings and streetlights in view.

Suggested post time: 7–9pm ET — catches supporters after work when engagement peaks for Q&A-style posts; evening contrast with a predawn scene sparks conversation.

Your caption should feel like a trusted colleague sharing a meaningful moment—specific, warm, and consent-first. Invite people in rather than perform impact.
