## The Prompt

```
Impact Statistic Visualization Caption Generator

Purpose: Create platform-ready social captions (with accessibility and optional designer guidance) for nonprofit impact statistics that earn engagement, saves, and shares.

Best for: Program milestones, annual report highlights, campaign updates, funder accountability posts.

STEP 1: Provide Your Information (copy/paste and fill in)
Required
1) Organization: [ORG NAME]
2) Primary stat (number + what it measures): [e.g., “1,247 students served” or “89% graduation rate”]
3) Platform: [Instagram / Facebook / LinkedIn / X]
4) Target audience: [Donors / Funders / Volunteers / Community]
5) Timeframe: [e.g., “in 2024,” “Jan–Jun 2025,” “since 2019,” “as of Oct 2025”]
6) Geography/community: [e.g., “in rural Montana,” “across 12 Chicago neighborhoods”]
7) Source + year/URL: [e.g., “Internal program data, 2024” or “2024 Annual Report, URL”]

Required if using a percentage
8) Base/denominator: [e.g., “89% of 340 participants”]

Optional but recommended
9) Relatable comparison: [e.g., “equal to the population of Boise,” “enough to fill Soldier Field”]
10) Call to action (CTA): [e.g., “Donate monthly,” “Volunteer this weekend,” “Save and share”]
11) Tone preference: [FORMAL / WARM / CASUAL] (default WARM)
12) Staff quote/sign-off: [e.g., “—Maria Chen, Program Director”] (use only if adding a quote)
13) Designer notes needed?: [Yes/No] (default No)

If any required fields are missing, I will ask up to 3 concise clarification questions before generating. If a percentage lacks a base or date, I will convert to an absolute number if possible or ask for details.

STEP 2: Generate the Caption Package

Produce Two Caption Options (A & B)
- Length: 60–80 words each (see platform overrides below)
- Use the SAME primary stat in both options; vary the lead, framing, and CTA.
- A vs. B purpose: Two testable angles of the same fact.
  • Option A: Lead with program/solution impact.
  • Option B: Lead with community/individual perspective.

Required structure (per caption)
1) Opening (insight, not a number): One human takeaway or why it matters.
   - Weak: “We served 1,247 students this year.”
   - Strong: “When students get steady tutoring, confidence and grades rise.”
2) Stat sentence with full context: Number + what + who + when + where (and base if %).
   - Example: “In 2024, 1,247 students across 12 Chicago neighborhoods received free one-on-one tutoring through [ORG].”
3) Why it matters (plain language; no jargon/acronyms).
4) Relatable comparison (if provided or credibly inferrable).
5) Soft, platform-aligned CTA.
6) Source citation at the end: (Source: [SOURCE], [YEAR/URL]).
7) Hashtags: 2–4 relevant, TitleCase, at the very end.

Tone guidance
- FORMAL (funders/LinkedIn): Precise, credible, data-forward. No emojis.
- WARM (donors/community): Empathetic, hopeful, community-centered. Emoji ok (max 1).
- CASUAL (volunteers/Instagram): Friendly, plain language. Emoji ok (max 2).

Platform length and formatting overrides
- Instagram: Keep 60–80 words; front-load the hook in first 100–125 characters; 1–2 line breaks ok.
- Facebook: 60–100 words; front-load key info in first 140 characters; links in comments if needed.
- LinkedIn: 80–140 words; no emojis in FORMAL; use line breaks for scannability.
- X: Hard cap 280 characters; compress each option to ≤240 characters, leaving room for 1–2 short hashtags. Prioritize: insight + stat context + CTA + source abbrev.

Content rules for the statistic
- Always include timeframe and geography/community.
- If using a percentage, include base/denominator and timeframe (e.g., “89% of 340 participants in 2024”).
- Use round numbers unless precision is critical to credibility.
- People-first language; avoid deficit framing and guilt appeals.
- If comparison isn’t credible or may feel minimizing, omit it rather than forcing one.

Relatable comparison ideas (use one if supplied or appropriate)
- Population equivalence (e.g., “equal to the population of [Town]”)
- Venue capacity (e.g., “enough to fill [Landmark]”)
- Everyday scale (e.g., “about one full school bus per week”)

CTAs (select or adapt to platform)
- Instagram: “Save and share,” “Link in bio to donate monthly,” “Volunteer signup in bio.”
- Facebook: “Share this post,” “Donate at the link in comments,” “RSVP to volunteer.”
- LinkedIn: “Follow for data updates,” “Connect to explore funding partnerships,” “Read the full report.”
- X: “Retweet to spread the word,” “See link in thread for details.”

Alt Text (accessibility)
- Write 1–2 sentences, 120–160 characters total.
- Describe the visual style and state the exact statistic text as shown.
- No emojis, hashtags, or CTAs.
- Example: “Bold white text on navy background reads: 1,247 Chicago students received free tutoring in 2024. Small source line at bottom right.”

Designer Notes (include only if Step 1 #13 = Yes)
- Format: 1080×1080 (Instagram), 1200×628 (Facebook/X), 1200×1200 (LinkedIn)
- Visual: Single stat on simple solid background; no chart junk.
- Typography: Large, bold sans-serif; minimum 16–18pt on mobile; test color contrast ≥4.5:1.
- Hierarchy: Stat is hero; context smaller but readable; source bottom-right in 10–12pt.
- Branding: Use org brand colors; small logo in a corner.

Decision rules and conflict resolution
- Prioritize order: Platform constraints > Audience needs > Tone preference.
- If platform = LinkedIn but audience = Volunteers, keep FORMAL data clarity with a community-forward opening; avoid emojis.
- If percentage lacks a base or timeframe, convert to an absolute count or ask for details; do not post a standalone percent.
- If timeframe is ongoing, use “as of [Month Year].”
- If geography unspecified, ask for it; if unavailable, use the smallest accurate scope from the source.
- If comparison is absent or weak, omit it rather than stretching.
- If tone not specified, default to WARM.

Quality checklist (self-check before finalizing)
- Concrete and dignifying; people-first language.
- No deficit framing, guilt appeals, or clichés (e.g., “transform lives,” “change the world”).
- Verifiable: stat includes timeframe, geography, and base if %; cites a credible source.
- Mobile-first: short sentences, scannable, clear hierarchy.
- Platform-appropriate: tone and CTA match the channel.
- Numbers are rounded unless precision is needed.

Mini examples: weak vs strong openings
- Weak: “We served 2,300 meals.”
- Strong: “A dependable hot meal turns a tough day into a doable one.”

- Weak: “Our program reached 412 teens.”
- Strong: “When teens find a safe place to belong, they keep showing up—and keep growing.”
