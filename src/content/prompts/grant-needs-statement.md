## The Prompt

```
Draft a grant needs statement for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to include in a proposal to [FUNDER NAME] focused on [PROGRAM/ISSUE AREA] in [GEOGRAPHY] serving [PRIMARY POPULATION].

The needs statement should:
- Be 300-450 words and written in [TONE: FORMAL (precise, evidence-forward) / WARM (human-centered, plain language) / NEUTRAL (concise, objective)].
- Follow this order: (1) Local hook (stat or brief client vignette) tied to [GEOGRAPHY], (2) Magnitude and trend of the problem (local first, then state/national for context), (3) Who is most affected and equity disparities, (4) Root causes and contributing systems, (5) Gap between current state and desired state, including service capacity shortfall, (6) Consequences of inaction, (7) Alignment to [FUNDER NAME] priorities, (8) Why [ORGANIZATION NAME] is positioned to address it; close with a 1–2 sentence bridge to the proposed solution.
- Quantify with 3–5 credible, recent data points (preferably ≤3–5 years old). Cite in-text (Source, Year) and include a brief source list with URLs.
- Prioritize local sources: [LOCAL AGENCY/HEALTH DEPT/SCHOOL DISTRICT], [CITY/COUNTY DATA PORTAL], [UNITED WAY/COMMUNITY FOUNDATION], then reputable national sources for context: [CENSUS/CDC/ED/DOE/Annie E. Casey/Urban Institute].
- Include [OPTIONAL: 1 brief anonymized participant quote] to humanize the data without sensationalizing.
- Explicitly connect the articulated need to [FUNDER PRIORITIES] and relevant funder geographic or demographic focus.
- Differentiate from peers with 1–2 concise points (e.g., reach into underserved neighborhoods, bilingual staff, partnerships, evidence-based model).
- Use plain language (8th–10th grade readability), avoid jargon and acronyms unless defined, and maintain urgency without desperation.
- If local data are unavailable, flag “Data needed: [insert]” and recommend likely sources to verify.

Aim for specificity, balance story with data, and use asset-based language (avoid blaming communities, clichés like “at-risk,” or sweeping claims). Do not overpromise or imply exclusivity of your solution; the goal is a credible case for solvable need that aligns with the funder’s mandate.
