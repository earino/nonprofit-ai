TASK: Create three GivingTuesday emails

Email Timing & Labels
- Email 1: Morning Launch (7–9am [TIME ZONE]; if [RECIPIENT TIME ZONE] differs, note “[send 7–9am local time]”)
- Email 2: Mid‑Day Update (12–2pm [TIME ZONE]; note local time if varies)
- Email 3: Final Push (6–9pm [TIME ZONE]; note local time if varies)

For each email, include these components in this exact order:
1) Subject Line Options – 2 options, each 4–7 words
2) Preheader – 35–60 characters
3) Email Body – 150–220 words
4) CTA Button – 2–4 words linking to [DONATION LINK]
5) P.S. – one sentence
6) Social Share – one sentence inviting forward/share with [HASHTAGS] and [SOCIAL HANDLE]
7) Image Suggestion – one sentence with a recommended image and alt‑text (Email 1 and Email 3 only)

Content Requirements (apply to all three emails)
- Open with personalization using [FIRST NAME|"Friend"]
- Lead with a 1–2 sentence impact mini‑story about [BENEFICIARY/PROGRAM] that includes [IMPACT UNIT]
- State the campaign goal clearly:
  • Email 1: Introduce “[GOAL NUMBER] [GOAL TYPE]”
  • Email 2 and 3: Show progress with specific numbers (e.g., “127 of 500 donors so far — **25%** there” or “**$8,450** of **$25,000** raised”)
- If [MATCH DETAILS] ≠ “NONE”: name the amount, source, and deadline; show how gifts are doubled/boosted until the stated deadline
- If [MATCH DETAILS] = “NONE”: use a countdown to [DEADLINE TIME] and participation framing (“Add your name to today’s donor roll”)
- Include one sentence noting that GivingTuesday gifts build momentum for year‑end, not replace it
- Include social proof/community language (e.g., “Join 200 neighbors”)
- Maintain one clear CTA only; no secondary asks
- Signature from [FROM NAME], [TITLE]
- Invite to forward/share with friends/family
- Footer: tax‑deductibility with [EIN/LEGAL NAME], [PHYSICAL ADDRESS], and [UNSUBSCRIBE LINK]

Email‑Specific Elements
- Email 2 (Mid‑Day) Body: include one brief bulleted list with 3–5 bullets. Use bullets for any of:
  • Impact examples tied to [IMPACT UNIT]
  • Match/urgency status with numbers
  • Quick ways to participate (give, share, employer match)
  • Current community momentum (“X classrooms funded,” “X first‑time donors”)
- Email 3 (Final Push): emphasize last‑chance urgency without guilt, highlight the day’s momentum, and reinforce participation (“every donor counts”)

Writing Standards
- Mobile‑first: short paragraphs (2–3 sentences max), clear line breaks
- Scannable: you may indicate bold using **asterisks** for key numbers/deadlines
- Reading level: Grade 6–8; plain language, active voice
- Tone: match the selected [TONE] throughout
- Authentic, specific, community‑centered; avoid hype and vague phrases
- Avoid: clichés (“on this special day”), jargon, guilt/fright tactics, multiple CTAs, attachments

Segmentation (optional but recommended)
- Provide one optional one‑sentence swap in each email for:
  • New/prospective donors – welcoming and explains why today matters
  • Past donors – thanks for previous support and invites them back
