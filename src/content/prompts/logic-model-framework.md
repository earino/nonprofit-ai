## The Prompt

```
Create a one-page Logic Model Framework for [PROGRAM NAME] at [ORGANIZATION NAME], serving [COMMUNITY/POPULATION] in [GEOGRAPHY] over [TIMEFRAME].

The logic model framework should:
- Begin with 3–5 end outcomes/impact statements, then work backward to intermediate and short-term outcomes, outputs, activities, and inputs using clear if-then logic.
- Present a single-page table with columns: Inputs | Activities | Outputs | Short-term Outcomes (6–12 mo) | Intermediate Outcomes (1–3 yrs) | Long-term Outcomes/Impact (3+ yrs) | Indicators & Targets | Data Sources & Frequency | Responsible Role | Assumptions/External Factors | Equity Considerations. Aim for 8–12 rows total.
- Distinguish outputs (units delivered) from outcomes (changes in knowledge/behavior/status); include 1–3 SMART indicators per level with numeric targets where possible.
- Include a concise 250–350 word narrative summary explaining program rationale, equity approach, key assumptions, and how the logic model will guide implementation and evaluation.
- Add a 2-sentence note clarifying how this logic model differs from a theory of change (visual flow vs. broader causal narrative).
- Right-size the plan for a small team of [TEAM SIZE] with a budget of [BUDGET RANGE]; propose feasible data collection methods aligned to [DATA CAPACITY: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH].
- Name primary beneficiaries, disaggregate indicators by [EQUITY PRIORITY: e.g., age, race, zip] where appropriate, and avoid deficit framing.
- List top 3 assumptions and top 3 risks/external factors; state mitigation steps.
- Include a quarterly review cadence and “update triggers” (e.g., staffing shifts, policy changes, underperforming indicators).
- Provide 3–5 discussion questions to align staff/partners and surface hidden assumptions.
- Add a header: Prepared by [ROLE], for [AUDIENCE: funder/board/internal], Date [DATE].
- Use [TONE: FORMAL (funder-ready, precise)/WARM (community-friendly, plain language)/CASUAL (internal, succinct)].

Quality note: Use concrete, measurable language; avoid vague phrases (“raise awareness”) without a baseline/target. Keep it nonprofit-focused, capacity-aware, and equity-centered. Do not use jargon or buzzwords without definitions. Ensure each if-then link is testable and the model is practical for ongoing management, not just grant compliance.
