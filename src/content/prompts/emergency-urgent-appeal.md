## The Prompt

```
Create a rapid-turn, donor-ready emergency fundraising appeal for a genuine, time-bound need at [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The emergency appeal email should:
- Be written for [AUDIENCE SEGMENT: ALL DONORS/MAJOR DONORS/MONTHLY DONORS/NEW DONORS] in [TONE: FORMAL (measured, data-forward), WARM (compassionate, community-centered), DIRECT (plain, calm-urgent)] aligned with [BRAND VOICE NOTES].
- Include: 3 subject lines, 1 preheader, salutation, body (250–350 words), clear CTA with [DONATION LINK]/[PHONE], P.S. restating deadline and impact, and sign-off from [SIGNER NAME/TITLE] (add [BOARD CHAIR NAME/TITLE] if appropriate).
- Open with what happened [EMERGENCY TYPE/WHAT HAPPENED], who is affected [WHO IS AFFECTED], and where [GEOGRAPHY]—specific, witnessed details; avoid sensationalism.
- State a precise, time-bound goal: “We must raise [SPECIFIC DOLLAR GOAL] by [DEADLINE DATE/TIME] to [PURPOSE].” Include the consequence of missing the deadline.
- Provide a credible plan: 3–4 bullets on how funds will be used immediately (e.g., staffing, supplies, direct aid, logistics), with expected timeline.
- Demonstrate readiness: 1–2 sentences on track record/partnerships [CREDIBILITY POINTS].
- Include an impact ladder tied to giving: “$[AMOUNT 1] = [IMPACT]; $[AMOUNT 2] = [IMPACT]; $[AMOUNT 3] = [IMPACT].” Use real, verifiable numbers [IMPACT PER $].
- If applicable, integrate [MATCH DETAILS] with clear terms and cutoff; otherwise omit.
- Offer alternate ways to give (1 line): check/DAF/stock/[ALTERNATIVE GIVING METHODS].
- Maintain dignity-first language for people served; write at ~8th-grade level; avoid clichés (“now more than ever,” “unprecedented”) unless accurate; no guilt or fear tactics.
- Add a 40–60 word “Board Fast-Track Justification” summarizing urgency, goal, deadline, and risk of inaction for quick approval.
- End with a commitment to report back within 72 hours on initial impact and within 30 days on outcomes.

Quality matters: authenticity + specificity build trust. Use concrete details, plain language, and verifiable figures. Keep the ask clear and immediate, not manipulative. If any bracketed detail is unknown, insert a plausible placeholder and tag [VERIFY] so staff can confirm quickly.
