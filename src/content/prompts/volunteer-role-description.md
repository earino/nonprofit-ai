If a field is blank, propose a sensible default and flag it in [brackets]. If something doesn’t apply, write “Not applicable” or omit.

STRUCTURE & CONTENT (output must use these 9 numbered headings)
1) Role Title
2) Brief Overview (2–3 sentences)
- What the volunteer will do and why it matters.
- Include impact: “Each shift helps [IMPACT METRIC], advancing [MISSION/CAUSE].”
3) Responsibilities (4–6 bullets)
- Be concrete. GOOD: “Greet visitors and check them in using our sign-in iPad.” BAD: “Support front desk operations.”
- Tailor to [VOLUNTEER TYPE] (e.g., one-time event = day-of tasks; board = governance/strategy; skilled = defined deliverables; virtual = tools/platforms).
4) Time Commitment
- State: [HOURS/WEEK], [DURATION], [SCHEDULE/FLEXIBILITY], [LOCATION], [ON-SITE/REMOTE/HYBRID].
5) Qualifications
- Required (must-have): keep minimal.
- Preferred (nice-to-have): end with “Don’t meet every preferred item? We encourage you to apply.”
6) Training & Support
- Note training, supervision, materials. Add reimbursements/stipends if applicable; if none, say “No out-of-pocket costs.”
7) Screening & Requirements
- State simply (e.g., “Background check—cost covered by [ORG NAME]”). Include age/confidentiality only if essential. If none, write “No background check required.”
8) Inclusion & Accessibility
- Always include: “We welcome volunteers of all backgrounds and abilities. To request accommodations, contact [NAME/EMAIL/PHONE].”
9) Application Process & Contact
- How to apply, response time, target start date, and “Posted by [CONTACT NAME], [TITLE], [PHONE/EMAIL], [ORGANIZATION NAME].”

STYLE & TONE
- Length: 250–350 words total; prioritize clarity over strict count.
- Reading level: 8th–10th grade; short sentences; plain words.
- Tone: [FORMAL / WARM / CASUAL] (choose one and use consistently).
- Format: plain text with numbered headings and bullets; include hyperlinks in parentheses for digital use; spell out URLs for print.

EXAMPLE SNIPPET (tone: WARM, ~50 words)
“As a Weekend Pantry Greeter, you’ll welcome neighbors, check them in on our iPad, and answer simple questions. Each 3-hour shift helps 60 households access fresh, healthy food—moving us closer to a hunger-free community. We’ll train you on our check-in app and have a staff lead nearby for support.”

MUST DO
- Be honest about time and requirements.
- Make tasks specific and scannable.
- Use inclusive, welcoming language.

NEVER DO
- Use legalese, clichés (“rockstar”), or vague phrases (“other duties as assigned”).
- Create unnecessary barriers in “Required.”

QUALITY CHECK
Before finalizing, ensure someone could read this in 90 seconds and know if they’re a fit, what they’ll do, and how to apply.

OUTPUT
Produce one polished role description following the 9 headings above. Do not include tips or commentary in the final output.
