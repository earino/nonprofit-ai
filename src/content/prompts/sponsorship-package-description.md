## The Prompt

```
Write a one-page sponsorship package description for [EVENT NAME] hosted by [ORGANIZATION NAME] on [DATE] at [LOCATION].

The sponsorship package description should:
- Open with a 2–3 sentence mission snapshot linking sponsor support to [BENEFICIARIES/PROGRAM IMPACT] and the event’s purpose.
- Present 3–5 tiers with clear names and amounts: use [TIER NAMES/AMOUNTS] if provided; otherwise propose levels appropriate for a [SMALL/RURAL/URBAN] market and [EXPECTED ATTENDANCE]/[EVENT BUDGET], with meaningful differentiation.
- For each tier, list concrete benefits sponsors care about and your small team can deliver: logo placements ([WEBSITE/EMAIL/PROGRAM/ON-SITE SIGNAGE]), recognition ([STAGE/MC/SCREEN]), quantified digital posts, ticket/VIP quantities, activation/speaking rights, exhibit table, and category exclusivity (if any).
- Include an In‑Kind Sponsor option specifying [IN‑KIND NEEDS] (e.g., printing, catering, A/V, media) valued at fair market rate and mapped to the closest cash tier.
- Provide audience and reach: [EXPECTED ATTENDANCE], [AUDIENCE DEMOGRAPHICS], [EMAIL LIST SIZE], [SOCIAL FOLLOWERS], [MEDIA PARTNERS/SPONSORS], to indicate marketing value.
- Add a “Why It Matters” section with 3 impact lines that translate dollars to outcomes (e.g., $5,000 = [IMPACT EXAMPLE]).
- State deadlines: commitment by [COMMITMENT DEADLINE]; assets by [ARTWORK DEADLINE] and [PRINT DEADLINE]; note that benefits depend on timely materials.
- Offer optional add‑ons (limited quantity): [BRANDED ACTIVATION/EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEER DAY/MATCHING CHALLENGE/PHOTO BOOTH/STEP‑AND‑REPEAT LOGO].
- Include recognition policy and tax note: logo order by level, exclusivity rules, and 501(c)(3) acknowledgment language (no goods/services value vs. fair market value).
- Close with a clear CTA and contact block signed by [NAME], [TITLE], [EMAIL], [PHONE].
- Word count: 450–650 words. Tone: [TONE]—FORMAL (corporate/procurement), WARM (community/mission‑forward), CASUAL (youth/culture).

Deliver scannable, specific benefits (quantify posts/tickets/impressions), keep mission‑first, avoid clichés/jargon (“win‑win,” “synergy”), don’t overpromise, and price tiers to cover 40–60% of event costs pre‑ticket sales. Use clear headers and bullets so this can be dropped into a one‑pager with minimal edits.
