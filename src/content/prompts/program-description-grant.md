## The Prompt

```
Write a concise, funder-ready program description for [PROGRAM NAME] at [ORGANIZATION NAME], tailored to [FUNDER NAME] and aligned with [FUNDER PRIORITIES].

The program description should:
- Be 250-350 words, in active voice, at a 9th–11th grade reading level.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (precise, objective, grant-ready), WARM (community-centered, accessible, still professional), or CASUAL (plain-spoken, minimal jargon; avoid slang).
- Assume reviewers are not experts in [FIELD]; define any acronym on first use and avoid jargon.
- Follow this exact structure and order:
  1) One-sentence program summary; 2) Why: local need with 1–2 data points; 3) Who: target population and size; 4) What: core services/activities; 5) How: model/methods/evidence base; 6) When: frequency, duration, timeline; 7) Where: delivery setting(s); 8) Outputs/outcomes and how measured; 9) Capacity/partners/equity and access.
- Quantify specifics: [ANNUAL UNDUPLICATED PARTICIPANTS], [TARGET POPULATION DESCRIPTION], [STAFFING/FTE AND ROLES], [DOSAGE/FREQUENCY/DURATION], [CASELOAD OR RATIO], [LOCATIONS/GEOGRAPHY], [PARTNERS].
- Cite or name the evidence base or practice model (e.g., “grounded in [MODEL/RESEARCH SOURCE]”) and note fidelity/adaptations relevant to [COMMUNITY CONTEXT].
- Describe equity and access strategies (language access, ADA, transportation, outreach) relevant to [TARGET POPULATION].
- Include concrete outputs and outcomes with indicators: [EXPECTED OUTPUTS], [SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES], [METRICS], and [DATA COLLECTION METHODS].
- Briefly note organizational capacity and fit: [RELEVANT EXPERIENCE], [YEARS RUNNING], [SYSTEMS/TOOLS], and how the scope matches a small team’s resources.
- Explicitly connect to [FUNDER NAME] priorities using 1–2 mirrored keywords from the RFP.
- Attribution: no signature needed; write in [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s voice.

Aim for clarity and credibility: be specific, measurable, and realistic. Avoid clichés (“transformational,” “game-changing”), over-claims, and value judgments about participants. Do not include budget details unless requested. Keep sentences tight, prefer concrete numbers over adjectives, and ensure every claim is supported by a method, partner, or metric reviewers can recognize.
