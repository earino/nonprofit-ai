## The Prompt

```
Create a 6–8 week, resource-light, multi-channel event marketing campaign plan for [EVENT NAME] by [ORGANIZATION NAME] on [EVENT DATE] in [VENUE/CITY], aiming for [TARGET NUMBER] registrations (capacity: [CAPACITY], ticket: [TICKET PRICE]) and secondary goals: [SECONDARY GOALS]. Assume no paid ads; focus on organic, partner, and board amplification. Start date: [CAMPAIGN START DATE]. Registration link: [REGISTRATION LINK]. Event hashtag: [HASHTAG]. Primary audiences: [PRIMARY AUDIENCES]. Platforms: [PLATFORMS].

The campaign plan should:
- Open with a one-paragraph event snapshot tying the event to mission/impact, plus key facts (date, place, capacity, pricing, hashtag).
- Define SMART goals and KPIs with targets by channel (email, social, partner, PR) and funnel assumptions; include a “How did you hear about us?” field plan.
- Provide a week-by-week timeline (W-8 to event day) covering: Save-the-Date, Invitation, Early-Bird ends [EARLY BIRD DEADLINE], speaker/sponsor reveals, partner pushes, and a final 7-day and 72-hour countdown.
- Email plan: 4–6 sends with dates, segments, subject lines, preview text, and 80–120 word body copy templates; include one resend strategy.
- Social plan: 2–3 posts/week total across [PLATFORMS] with specific dates, 50–80 word captions, suggested visuals, best times, and hashtags (include [HASHTAG]).
- Partner/sponsor/board activation: a toolkit checklist, two 75–100 word outreach email templates, sample posts, and unique UTM/QR codes.
- PR/local outreach: 100–120 word media pitch, 80–100 word community calendar listing, and 6–10 outlet ideas.
- Urgency levers: early-bird, limited seats, price increase, speaker drops; specify dates and sample lines that create FOMO without pressure.
- Web/landing page improvements: headline, 3 bullet value props, testimonial, accessibility notes, SEO snippet (140–160 chars).
- Measurement and course-correct plan: UTM table, weekly reporting cadence, action if under target at W-2; budget options ($0–$[BUDGET]).
- Roles/approvals: who does what (staff/volunteers), estimated hours/week, and sign-off flow.
- Deliverables: calendar grid and one-page executive summary; include all links and assets checklist (logos, bios, photos, alt text).

Length: 800–1,100 words. Tone: [TONE] — FORMAL (board-ready, concise), WARM (community-centered, inviting), CASUAL (friendly, energetic). Prepared by [ROLE/NAME]; approved by [ROLE/NAME].

Make it concrete and schedulable: specific dates, copy, and assets—not generic advice. Use inclusive, plain language; avoid clichés (“unprecedented”), desperation, or donor-only framing. Prioritize accessibility (alt text, captions, readable fonts) and dignity-first messaging. This plan should be ready to brief staff/volunteers and implement with minimal edits.
