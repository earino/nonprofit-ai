## The Prompt

```
Use the inputs below to draft an ethical, impact-focused success story from beneficiary data for [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The success story should:
- Be tailored to [PRIMARY AUDIENCE: DONORS/FUNDERS/COMMUNITY] and centered on [BENEFICIARY PSEUDONYM OR FIRST NAME] ([PRONOUNS], [AGE OR AGE RANGE]) in [LOCATION (GENERALIZED)].
- Follow this structure with brief headings: 1) Headline; 2) Snapshot (1–2 lines: who, program, key outcome); 3) Before; 4) During [PROGRAM NAME]; 5) After/Results; 6) What this means (connect to broader impact); 7) Call to Action.
- Integrate specific outcomes and data (e.g., [OUTCOME DATA POINTS], [TIMEFRAME]) that corroborate the story; avoid vague claims.
- Include at least one participant voice quote: “[PARTICIPANT QUOTE]”; optionally one staff quote with role: “[STAFF QUOTE OPTIONAL].”
- Emphasize participant agency (they set goals, took actions); present the program as support, not savior.
- Protect privacy: use first name or pseudonym only; omit [IDENTIFIERS TO OMIT]; generalize dates/locations. If [MINOR OR VULNERABLE: YES], note guardian consent and remove school/workplace/time-specific details.
- Confirm consent metadata: [CONSENT STATUS: YES/NO], [PHOTO CONSENT: YES/NO]. If photo consent is NO, omit photo mentions; if YES, include a suggested alt text.
- Length: 400–600 words.
- Tone [TONE]: FORMAL (clear, evidence-forward for funders) / WARM (human, respectful, mission-aligned for donors) / CASUAL (lighter, still dignified for social/community).
- Include a specific, low-friction call to action: [CALL TO ACTION].
- Add byline: “By [AUTHOR NAME/TITLE]” and a one-line program descriptor for reuse.
- Provide a 6–10 word headline and 1–2 pull quotes (15–25 words each).

Aim for concrete, human-centered, and respectful. Avoid trauma details, savior language, pity, clichés (“changed forever”), and jargon. The before–during–after arc shows progress, data makes it credible, and quotes add dignity and voice. Keep details non-identifying and ensure the individual story reflects program-wide outcomes without overgeneralizing.
