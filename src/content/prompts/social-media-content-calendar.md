## The Prompt

```
Create a month-long social media content calendar for [ORGANIZATION NAME] for [MONTH/YEAR] that a one-person team can execute efficiently.

The calendar should:
- Cover platforms: [FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM/LINKEDIN/X/TIKTOK] (select which apply for our audience).
- Plan [2-3/3-5/5-7] posts per week total; set a realistic split by platform based on [FOLLOWER SIZE] (e.g., Facebook 2-3x/week for <10K).
- Organize by week with specific post dates and 1 “Flex/Timely” slot weekly for news, partnerships, or rapid response.
- Follow 60-30-10: tag each post as Education/Impact (60%), Community/BTS (30%), or Ask (10%) and balance across platforms.
- For each post include: platform, date, theme, caption template, visual/asset suggestion + aspect ratio, alt-text (20–30 words), best time (local [TIMEZONE]), 3–6 platform-appropriate hashtags, CTA/link (add [UTM CAMPAIGN]), audience segment [DONORS/VOLUNTEERS/CLIENTS/PARTNERS], and repurposing notes for other platforms.
- Caption lengths: Facebook/Instagram 50–90 words; LinkedIn 80–150 words; X 200–240 characters. Emojis [EMOJI: NONE/SPARING/FREQUENT]. Use first-person plural “we,” and note when to sign off by [STAFF NAME/TITLE] for personal stories.
- Optimize per platform (e.g., no links in IG captions; IG carousel/Reel guidance; LinkedIn mentions; X threads when needed).
- Integrate key dates: [CAMPAIGNS/EVENTS/ADVOCACY DAYS], awareness days, and program milestones; map to [CONTENT THEMES/BRAND PILLARS].
- Include two batch-creation blocks with grouped tasks (copy, assets, approvals) and a suggested scheduling plan using [TOOL].
- Provide an end section: weekly review checklist, simple tracker (Date | Platform | Posted? | Link), and KPI targets (reach, saves, CTR) for learning.
- Tone: [FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL] — FORMAL = funder/policy-ready; WARM = community-centered and hopeful; CASUAL = approachable and playful.
- Total output length: 800–1,100 words.

Prioritize clarity, inclusivity, and consent (no jargon, clichés, guilt/fright appeals, or “savior” framing). Use plain language (grade 7–9), people-first language, accurate alt-text, and ensure asks are specific and time-bound. Keep cadence consistent to reduce burnout; Flex slots maintain relevance without derailing the plan.
