## The Prompt

```
VOLUNTEER THANK‑YOU LETTER GENERATOR (NONPROFIT)

Goal: Generate a personalized volunteer thank‑you letter that strengthens retention, shows genuine appreciation, and works for email or print—without any fundraising asks.

HOW TO USE (QUICK START: 5 REQUIRED FIELDS)
Fill these, then add any optional fields you have.
1) [VOLUNTEER NAME] (preferred name)
2) [PROGRAM/PROJECT] (e.g., “Saturday food distribution,” “after‑school tutoring”)
3) [CONTRIBUTION] (what they did; e.g., “sorted 500 lbs,” “mentored 3 students”)
4) [TIME PERIOD] (e.g., “in March,” “this spring,” “Jan–Mar 2025”)
5) [SIGNER NAME & TITLE] (e.g., “Maria Chen, Volunteer Coordinator”)

Optional: [ORGANIZATION NAME] (for subject line), [TONE] (WARM default / FORMAL / CASUAL), [GENERATE MODE] (SINGLE LETTER default / TEMPLATE FOR BULK)

LETTER REQUIREMENTS
Structure (follow this order):
1) Salutation using inclusive name/pronouns
2) Specific appreciation tied to mission and their role in [PROGRAM/PROJECT] + [CONTRIBUTION]
3) Quantified impact with concrete numbers + one brief example/anecdote
4) Sense of community/belonging
5) Optional next touchpoint (non‑fundraising)
6) Warm close and signature block
7) Optional P.S. with one concise impact stat

Format:
- 150–220 words total
- 6th–8th grade reading level; plain language; short sentences
- Scannable: 2–4 short paragraphs (2–3 sentences each), plus optional P.S.
- Dual‑purpose: email body or printable letter
- If [ORGANIZATION NAME] provided, include an email subject line

Tone (choose one):
- WARM (default): friendly, heartfelt, personal
- FORMAL: polished, respectful (board/corporate/leadership)
- CASUAL: upbeat, conversational (peers/youth)

Must include:
- At least one specific number (e.g., hours, items, people served, % change)
- Clear link to mission and community
- Zero fundraising or donation language

Avoid:
- Clichés (“we couldn’t do it without you,” “rockstar”)
- Jargon (“leverage,” “stakeholders,” “synergy”)
- Generic praise without specifics

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (ADD WHAT YOU HAVE)
Personalization:
- [VOLUNTEER LEVEL] (FIRST‑TIME / RECURRING / TEAM LEAD / BOARD / INTERN / EVENT‑DAY)
- [TENURE] (e.g., “since 2023,” “40 total hours,” “started 9/15/2024”)
- [PREFERRED PRONOUNS] (for inclusive salutation)
- [VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY NAME] (e.g., “Garden Squad,” “our volunteer family”)

Impact details:

- [OUTPUT] (e.g., “600 meals packed,” “25 kits assembled”)
- [IMPACT METRIC] (e.g., “helped 180 families,” “15% increase in students reached”)
- [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE] (brief anecdote or quote from staff/participant)

Mission and next step:
- [MISSION SHORT] (10–15 words)
- [NEXT TOUCHPOINT] (non‑ask; e.g., “training on April 12,” “appreciation picnic,” “newsletter signup”)

Signature and delivery:
- [CONTACT INFO] (email/phone)
- [SIGNATURE IMAGE ALT‑TEXT] (for accessibility; else omit)
- [DELIVERY CONTEXT] (EMAIL / PRINT) if you want slight formatting tweaks

FALLBACKS (IF DATA IS MISSING)
- No anecdote? Insert [ADD SPECIFIC EXAMPLE] as a visible placeholder.
- No hours or output? Use program‑level [IMPACT METRIC] if available. If none, use neutral phrasing and insert [NUMBER NEEDED] as a placeholder. Do not fabricate numbers.
- Not sure of level/tenure? Omit those lines rather than guessing.

MAIL‑MERGE / BULK USE
- If [GENERATE MODE] = TEMPLATE FOR BULK, retain all [BRACKETED] fields for mail‑merge and do not invent data.
- Keep placeholders visible for fields you will import later (e.g., [VOLUNTEER NAME], [HOURS], [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE]).

OUTPUT WILL INCLUDE
- Email subject line (if [ORGANIZATION NAME] provided)
- Complete letter that follows the required structure and word count
- Bracketed fields preserved for mail‑merge; no invented data
- Signature block: [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE], [CONTACT INFO]
- Optional P.S. with one concise stat
- If [SIGNATURE IMAGE ALT‑TEXT] provided, include one line noting it for accessibility
