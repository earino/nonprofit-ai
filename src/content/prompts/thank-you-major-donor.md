## The Prompt

```
Write a personalized, meaningful thank-you letter for a major donor who gave
$[AMOUNT] to [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Express deep appreciation for their transformational gift
- Acknowledge the significance and impact of this level of support
- Describe the specific, concrete outcomes their $[AMOUNT] will enable
- Use storytelling to show real-world impact (not just statistics)
- Reference their donor history if applicable: [DONOR HISTORY]
- Mention the specific program or initiative: [PROGRAM/INITIATIVE NAME]
- Indicate next steps in stewardship (personal update, site visit, meeting, etc.)
- Make them feel like a critical partner in the mission, not just a donor
- Be 300-400 words
- Use a [WARM/PROFESSIONAL/PERSONAL] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE] - ideally ED or Board Chair

The letter should feel personal and thoughtful, as if written specifically for this
donor. Avoid generic language or template-like phrasing. This is a relationship-
building communication, not just an acknowledgment.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[AMOUNT]** with the major gift amount ($1,000+)
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[DONOR HISTORY]** with relevant background (e.g., "You've supported us for five years" or "This is your first major gift")
4. Replace **[PROGRAM/INITIATIVE NAME]** with what they funded
5. Replace **[WARM/PROFESSIONAL/PERSONAL]** with appropriate tone for this donor
6. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with ED or Board leadership
7. Consider adding specific details you know about the donor (their interests, connections, motivation for giving)

## Pro Tips

1. **Handwrite if possible**: Major donors deserve handwritten notes - AI can draft, you personalize by hand
2. **Call first, then write**: For gifts over $5K, call to thank them before mailing the letter
3. **Be specific about their gift**: Don't use template language - reference the exact amount and what it funds
4. **Future engagement**: Mention specific next touch point (lunch meeting, site visit, progress report)
5. **From the top**: Major gift letters should come from ED, Board Chair, or both
6. **Same-day acknowledgment**: Send within 24 hours if possible
7. **Tell one story**: One specific person or outcome their gift impacts is more powerful than listing many things
