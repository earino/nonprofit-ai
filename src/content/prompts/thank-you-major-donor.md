## The Prompt

```
Draft a highly personalized major-donor thank-you letter for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that a busy leader can send the same day a gift is received.

The letter should:
- Be 250-350 words, one page, 3-5 short paragraphs, readable at Grade 8-10 level.
- Include this order/structure: [DONOR ADDRESS BLOCK] > [DATE] > [SALUTATION] > Opening that references the call on [CALL DATE] > Clear thanks acknowledging [AMOUNT] and [GIFT TYPE] received on [DATE OF GIFT] > Specifics on how funds will be used for [PROGRAM/PROJECT] in [LOCATION] > Concrete early impact (numbers, timeline, example) > What happens next and when > Closing that frames partnership > [SIGNATURE BLOCK] > P.S. with a human, relational note.
- Personalize with 1-2 details from cultivation: [SPECIFIC DETAIL FROM CONVERSATION] and [DONOR INTEREST/VALUES].
- Describe allocation and impact with specifics (e.g., “Your [AMOUNT] funds [X UNITS/SERVICES] by [MONTH/YEAR], serving [# PEOPLE/FAMILIES].”).
- Name beneficiaries respectfully (people-first language), center community impact, not donor heroics.
- Include stewardship plan and timing: [FOLLOW-UP ACTION] by [FOLLOW-UP DATE] (e.g., site visit, impact brief, photo update).
- Confirm public recognition preference: “We will list you as [RECOGNITION NAME] unless you prefer anonymity.”
- Note receipt handling without being transactional: “A formal receipt will arrive separately from our finance team.”
- Use [TONE]=FORMAL (conservative, honorific, boardroom-ready) / WARM (professional, relational, gracious) / CASUAL (first-name, friendly, still respectful).
- Author and sign from [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE] (ED or Board Chair); optional co-sign by [CO-SIGNER NAME/TITLE]. Include direct contact line.
- If any bracket is not provided, omit it gracefully.

Quality: Make it specific, human, and partnership-oriented; avoid clichés (“game-changer”), jargon (“capacity-building”), exclamation overload, and any new solicitation. Reflect the same-day call, show exactly “what your gift makes possible,” and set one clear next step with a date.
