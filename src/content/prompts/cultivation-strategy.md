## The Prompt

```
Develop a Major Donor Cultivation Strategy Plan for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to engage [PROSPECT NAME] over [TIMELINE MONTHS] months toward [PROPOSED ASK RANGE] for [PROJECT/PURPOSE].

The Cultivation Strategy Plan should:
- Use sections in this order: Header; 1) Prospect Snapshot; 2) Cultivation Goal & Case; 3) Strategy & Timeline; 4) Touchpoint Plan; 5) Engagement Signals & Decision Gates; 6) Roles & Coordination; 7) Risks/Contingencies; 8) Tracking & Next Steps; 9) Draft Ask Path & Natural Moment.
- Prospect Snapshot: [ESTIMATED CAPACITY], affinity indicators, prior giving to us/others, decision-making process, known connectors, preferred communication.
- Touchpoint Plan: outline 5–8 meaningful touches over 6–12 months; for each include objective, donor value, format (meeting/site visit/call/peer intro/salon/program update), owner ([PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP OWNER]/ED/Board/volunteer), date window, materials, and one qualification question. (Example: Site visit with program lead to observe [PROGRAM]; objective: connect impact to values; question: “How do you assess philanthropic priorities this year?”)
- Mix formats; each touch must deliver substance (impact data, beneficiary voice, field insight, invitation to advise), not “just checking in.”
- Roles & Coordination: when/why to involve [ED/BOARD INVOLVEMENT]/volunteer solicitor; briefing notes and follow-up responsibilities.
- Engagement Signals & Decision Gates: define readiness (responsiveness, outcome questions, budget curiosity, referral offered) and what triggers the ask.
- Draft Ask Path: framing for [PROPOSED ASK RANGE], designation options, likely objections with 1–2 sentence responses; identify the natural ask moment tied to a specific touch/event.
- Tracking: specify updates/tasks in [SYSTEM/CRM], fields to update, and simple metrics (meeting secured/site visit completed/pre-ask commitment).
- Capacity-aware: realistic for team of [TEAM SIZE]; include low-cost options and time estimates per touch.
- Include key dates: [KEY DATES/EVENTS] and any deadlines (board meetings, fiscal year-end).
- Word count: 600–900 words; internal planning document.
- Tone: [TONE: FORMAL (board-ready, precise) / WARM (relationship-centered, professional) / CASUAL (clear, small-shop shorthand)].
- Header lists: Prepared by [PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP OWNER]; Reviewed by [ED/BOARD LEAD].

Quality: Be donor-centered, concrete, and sequenced. Avoid clichés, guilt appeals, org-centric jargon, and vague “touches.” Each touch must have a purpose, owner, and date window. Common pitfalls to avoid: involving ED/Board too early/late, stacking asks without value, or failing to document next steps within 48 hours.
