## The Prompt

```
Write a special thank-you letter for a monthly/recurring donor who gives $[MONTHLY AMOUNT]
per month to [ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Express deep gratitude for their sustained, reliable support
- Emphasize how monthly gifts provide stability and predictable funding
- Show the cumulative impact of their giving (e.g., "$50/month = $600 annually, which provides...")
- Make them feel like an essential part of the organization's foundation
- Acknowledge how long they've been giving monthly: [DURATION]
- Reference what their recurring gift supports: [PROGRAM/FUND NAME]
- Reassure them their commitment makes planning and budgeting possible
- Include a gentle reminder they can update amount/payment method if needed
- Be 200-300 words
- Use a [WARM/APPRECIATIVE/PERSONAL] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should make monthly donors feel special and valued for their consistent
support. Emphasize the stability their giving provides, not just the amount.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[MONTHLY AMOUNT]** with their recurring gift amount
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[DURATION]** with how long they've been giving monthly (e.g., "for the past two years" or "since 2023")
4. Replace **[PROGRAM/FUND NAME]** with what their monthly gift supports
5. Replace **[WARM/APPRECIATIVE/PERSONAL]** with your preferred tone
6. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign
7. Calculate annual impact (monthly amount × 12) to show cumulative effect

## Pro Tips

1. **Send annually, not monthly**: Thank monthly donors with a special annual letter, not after each gift
2. **Show the math**: Help them see their cumulative impact over the year
3. **Acknowledge milestones**: Special recognition at 1 year, 5 years, 10 years of monthly giving
4. **Make it exclusive**: Use language like "sustaining donor" or "monthly partner" to create identity
5. **Provide updates**: Monthly donors deserve regular impact reports
6. **Easy to manage**: Include link to update payment method or amount (reduce friction)
7. **Retention focus**: Monthly donors are your most valuable - invest in keeping them engaged
