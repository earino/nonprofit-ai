QUALITY STANDARDS

Do
- Use specific, human language and real numbers
- Show tangible outcomes and a clear annualized impact
- Keep pride inclusive and tone authentic to your organization

Avoid
- Clichés: “game-changer,” “we couldn’t do it without you,” “make a difference”
- Jargon or corporate buzzwords
- Exclamation overuse (max 1 total)
- Any upgrade ask, additional donation request, or fundraising link
- Generic platitudes—be concrete

Bad example (do not emulate)
“Dear Friend, Your monthly gift is a game-changer! We couldn’t do it without you! Please increase your gift today to make an even bigger difference.”

USAGE NOTE
Best used at enrollment and then quarterly. Vary the micro-story each quarter to prevent repetition while reinforcing steadiness and cumulative impact. The goal is retention through appreciation, not an ask.

OUTPUT FORMAT
