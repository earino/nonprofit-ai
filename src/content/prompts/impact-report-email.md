## The Prompt

```
Write an impact report email for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to [PRIMARY AUDIENCE] summarizing [TIMEFRAME] results and linking to the full report.

The email should:
- Include 4–6 subject line options (≤55 characters) and one preheader (60–90 characters) tailored to [PRIMARY AUDIENCE] and [SECONDARY AUDIENCE] if noted.
- Open with a clear headline that leads with the top outcome/stat (plain language), then a brief thank-you that credits supporters’ role.
- Present 3–5 key metrics with context: number, denominator or baseline/target, and “so what” in 1 short clause. Format as a scannable bullet list with bold numerals. Use: [TOP 3–5 METRICS WITH CONTEXT].
- Include a 2–3 sentence beneficiary story plus one quote: [BENEFICIARY QUOTE]. Use [BENEFICIARY NAME/ANON/PSEUDONYM] to protect privacy.
- Acknowledge one challenge (1–2 sentences) and how you’re addressing it (1–2 sentences): [CHALLENGE]; [HOW WE’RE ADDRESSING IT]. Frame as learning and next steps.
- Add a “What’s next” line tied to [TIMEFRAME] and upcoming milestone or goal.
- Provide a primary CTA button/linked line to the full report: [LINK TO FULL REPORT], plus an optional secondary CTA [CALL TO ACTION] (e.g., share, volunteer, pledge).
- Use visual hierarchy for small teams: short paragraphs (1–3 sentences), descriptive subheads, bullets, bold key numbers, and one “mini‑infographic” line (e.g., “52% growth in [OUTCOME]”). Note any design constraints: [VISUAL NOTE].
- Keep 450–600 words, 6th–8th grade reading level, define acronyms once, localize if relevant: [LOCALIZATION].
- Tailor donor vs. funder vs. community framing using [AUDIENCE PRIORITIES] (e.g., stewardship vs. outcomes vs. services).
- Close with authentic gratitude and sign-off by [SIGNER NAME/TITLE]. Include contact info and standard footer language.
- Tone: [TONE]= FORMAL (grantmaker-ready, precise, neutral), WARM (donor-centered, appreciative, clear), CASUAL (community-friendly, conversational, still respectful).

Quality: Be concrete and transparent without jargon or hype; avoid clichés (“transforming lives”), guilt/fright appeals, vanity metrics, and link overload. Ensure numbers align across the email, spell out big numbers for readability, and include accessible copy (alt text cues if images later). The result should be paste-ready for Mailchimp/Constant Contact with clear scannability and a single primary action.
