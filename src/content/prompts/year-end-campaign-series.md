Your Task

Create a complete 3-email year-end fundraising campaign for [ORGANIZATION NAME] advancing [MISSION/CAUSE]. The series will deploy between December 1–31 and must be ready for copy/paste with minimal edits.

Campaign Structure & Timing

  - Introduce the year-end opportunity
  - Warm, invitational ask

- Email 2 (Send Dec 15–23): Urgency + Social Proof
  - Reinforce deadline and momentum
  - Show community participation and progress
  - Stronger, more direct ask

- Email 3 (Send Dec 28–31): Final Push
  - Anchor to tax-deductible deadline
  - Last-chance messaging
  - Clear, confident urgency with gratitude

Note: If starting after Dec 10, adjust cadence accordingly and include recommended send dates within the output.

- 1 preheader (35–80 characters, complements subject)
- From line: [SIGNER NAME], [TITLE]
- Opening hook (1–2 compelling lines)
- Body copy (short paragraphs, scannable, mobile-friendly)
- Primary CTA using [PRIMARY CTA URL] repeated 2–3 times with descriptive link text (avoid “click here”)
- P.S. line (optional for Email 1; recommended for Emails 2–3 to reinforce urgency, add personal note, or highlight match)

Image Guidance:

Tone & Voice Guidelines

Selected Tone: [TONE - FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL]
- Maintain consistent voice across all three emails
- Balance gratitude and urgency
- Ask clearly and confidently
- Avoid guilt-based or crisis-only framing
- Be concrete, human, and specific
- Avoid clichés (“make a difference,” “give back”), jargon, and corporate-speak

4) [UNOPENED]
- Provide: 3 alternative subject lines only (fresh angles; different length/voice)

Suppression Rule:

- Clear hierarchy and descriptive link text
- Include [EMAIL PREFERENCES/UNSUBSCRIBE LINK] placement note
