## The Prompt

```
Create a reusable, nonprofit-ready meeting agenda template for [MEETING TYPE] at [ORGANIZATION NAME] that improves outcomes while respecting small-team capacity.

The agenda template should:
- Start with a one-line purpose: “By the end of this meeting we will [OBJECTIVE]” (1–2 sentences max).
- Include a header block with fields: [DATE], [TIMEZONE], [MEETING LENGTH], [LOCATION/ZOOM LINK], [FACILITATOR], [NOTETAKER], [ATTENDEES/ROLES], [ACCESSIBILITY/INCLUSION NOTES].
- Use an agenda table with columns: Time (mins), Topic, Lead, Purpose (Decision/Discussion/FYI), Pre-reads/Links, Desired Outcome.
- Time-box items to total [MEETING LENGTH] (60–90 minutes for weekly staff; add a 5-minute break if 90+ minutes). Put decisions before updates.
- Add a 2–3 minute grounding check-in (mission/values or equity moment) and a 2-minute closing (next steps + appreciation).
- Include a “Parking Lot” with Owner + Follow-up Plan to capture off-topic items without derailing.
- Add “Decisions Made” and “Action Items” (Owner, Due Date, First Next Step) plus “Comms Out” (who needs to be informed: board, funders, volunteers, partners).
- Include a “Risks/Blocks/Resource Needs” section to surface capacity constraints early.
- Specify pre-work with due-by dates: [PRE-READS] with links; limit live updates to 10–15 minutes total.
- Provide distribution instructions (send 2–3 days in advance; attach pre-reads; file name: “[ORG]_[MEETING TYPE]_Agenda_[YYYY-MM-DD]”).
- Word count: keep instructional/explanatory text to 120–180 words; include a 60–90 word agenda email blurb.
- Tone: [TONE] = FORMAL (board/funder-facing); WARM (staff/coalition partners); CASUAL (volunteers/peer teams). Apply consistently.
- Prepared by [FACILITATOR]; Reviewed by [EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR/OPERATIONS COORDINATOR].

Produce concrete, plain-language fields and example entries (e.g., “Decide whether to submit the [GRANT NAME] by Friday” with 12-minute timebox). Avoid jargon, clichés, or vague topics (“updates” without outcomes). Limit to 5–7 agenda items. Use realistic nonprofit scenarios, prioritize mission-critical decisions, and make it easy for attendees to arrive prepared and leave with clear ownership.
