## The Prompt

```
Draft a board committee charter for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that the board can approve and use immediately to guide the work of the [COMMITTEE NAME] in [CURRENT YEAR].

The committee charter should:
- Be 600–900 words (1–2 pages), with clear headings and bullets; plain, accessible language.
- Open with Committee Name, Purpose, and Link to [MISSION/STRATEGIC PRIORITY], stating 2–3 concrete outcomes for the year.
- Define Scope and Boundaries: list 5–7 “In-Scope” tasks and 3–5 “Out-of-Scope” items to prevent overlap with [RELATED COMMITTEES].
- Specify Authority and Decision Rights: what the committee may decide, what requires board approval, any dollar thresholds ([BUDGET AUTHORITY]), and reference to bylaws/policies.
- Detail Composition: [COMMITTEE SIZE] voting members; allowance for non-board/community members if board size is [BOARD SIZE]; Chair selection [CHAIR SELECTION METHOD]; terms [TERM LENGTH]; DEI considerations.
- List Responsibilities: 6–10 specific, time-bound duties (e.g., “Review monthly financials; recommend annual budget to board by [MONTH]”), avoiding vague verbs like “support” or “oversee” without specifics.
- Set Meetings and Decision-Making: [MEETING FREQUENCY]; quorum of [QUORUM %]; how decisions are recorded; use of virtual meetings if applicable.
- Define Reporting: cadence to board ([REPORTING CADENCE]), required materials (brief written report, dashboard), and escalation path for risks.
- Clarify Staff Support: [STAFF LIAISON TITLE] role (agenda prep, data, minutes), realistic time expectations given staff size [STAFF SIZE].
- Outline Recruitment & Onboarding: member recruitment sources, orientation steps, succession plan for Chair/Vice-Chair, and expected time commitment.
- Include Ethics & Compliance: conflict of interest, confidentiality, alignment with relevant laws and funder requirements.
- Add Review & Sunset: annual review each [REVIEW MONTH]; criteria for success; conditions for pausing/dissolving the committee.

Use [TONE: FORMAL (policy-oriented, precise)/WARM (inclusive, plain language)/CASUAL (friendly, volunteer-forward)] and include signature blocks for Board Chair, Committee Chair, and Executive Director with adoption date [ADOPTION DATE].

Ensure outputs are specific, actionable, and aligned with nonprofit governance norms. Avoid corporate jargon and generic boilerplate. Make tasks realistic for a volunteer committee of [COMMITTEE SIZE] and a small staff. Guard against mission creep by stating what the committee will not do and when matters must be referred to the board.
