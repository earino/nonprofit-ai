## The Prompt

```
BEFORE YOU START
Required inputs: [ORGANIZATION NAME], [CAMPAIGN NAME], [ISSUE AREA], [PRIMARY AUDIENCES], [DATE RANGE], [CAMPAIGN GOALS], [TONE]
Optional inputs (use if applicable): [GEOGRAPHY], [KEY MESSAGES], [PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS], [CAMPAIGN DURATION], [OUTPUT MODE: QUICK or FULL]

Create a platform-specific hashtag strategy for [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [CAMPAIGN NAME] campaign.

Campaign context:
- Issue area: [ISSUE AREA]
- Geography (if any): [GEOGRAPHY]
- Primary audiences: [PRIMARY AUDIENCES]
- Dates/duration: [DATE RANGE] ([CAMPAIGN DURATION], if different)
- Goals: [CAMPAIGN GOALS] (e.g., awareness, donations, volunteers, policy)
- Key messages (optional): [KEY MESSAGES]
- Partners (optional): [PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS]
- Tone: [TONE]
  - FORMAL: Board/funders; precise, professional (e.g., “Leverage sector-specific tags for aligned reach.”)
  - WARM: Community/donors; encouraging, human (e.g., “Connect with neighbors and partners using…”)
  - CASUAL: Youth/volunteers; friendly, plain (e.g., “Use these tags to get the word out fast.”)

Output format and length:
- 500–700 words total, plus copy-ready hashtag lists
- Use simple bullet lists (no tables)
- Provide volume categories, not exact counts: HIGH (100K+), MEDIUM (5K–100K), LOW (<5K)
- Deliver concrete, mission-specific tags; avoid clichés and jargon

OPENING GOAL STATEMENT (1–2 sentences)
Start with a brief goal statement tied to [CAMPAIGN GOALS] and expected outcomes (reach, engagement, UGC, partner alignment).

PART 1: CAMPAIGN HASHTAG (100–150 words)
- Propose 3 options in CamelCase (e.g., #CleanWaterNow). For each: confirm uniqueness via quick native searches, note ambiguity risks, and partner-friendliness (length, clarity).
- Recommend ONE primary campaign hashtag with a 2–3 sentence rationale aligned to [PRIMARY AUDIENCES] and [CAMPAIGN GOALS].
- Provide a one-line adoption message partners can copy (e.g., “Join us: Use #CleanWaterNow to share your story.”)

PART 2: PLATFORM-SPECIFIC HASHTAG SETS (300–400 words)
Provide ready-to-use lists and a short strategy note for each platform:
- Instagram (10–15 total): 1–2 broad/high (HIGH), 3–4 niche/issue (MEDIUM), 1 campaign tag, 1 org tag (#[OrganizationName]), 2–3 audience/community or identity tags, 1–2 geographic tags (if [GEOGRAPHY]).
- LinkedIn (3–5 total): 1–2 professional/sector, 1 issue-area, 1 campaign, 1 org (if space).
- Facebook (3–5 total): 2–3 broad community/cause, 1 campaign, 1 org.
- X/Twitter (1–2 per post): campaign tag only OR campaign + 1 timely/trending tag.
For each platform: list the actual hashtags; label key tags with volume category (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW); add 2–3 sentences on why these fit the audiences, connect to current conversations, and how duration (short vs. multi-month) affects trending vs. evergreen choices.

PART 3: DO NOT USE LIST (50–75 words)
List 5–8 hashtags to avoid (banned/spammy, overused clichés, off-mission/ambiguous, or controversial). Give a brief reason for each.

PART 4: IMPLEMENTATION, TESTING, AND TRACKING (150–200 words)
- Placement & order: Instagram—first comment; order broad → niche → regional/identity → campaign → org. LinkedIn/Facebook—work 1–2 into text, rest at end. X—integrate in text; keep to 1–2. Respect character limits.
- Metrics (track weekly): Reach/impressions, Engagement rate ((likes+comments+shares)/reach), UGC count (unique accounts using the campaign tag), and Partner usage.
- Simple A/B test (2–3 week cadence): Version A = full recommended set; Version B = swap 2–3 niche tags or reduce count. Compare reach and engagement rate; keep the better performer.
- Quarterly refresh (30 minutes): native search recency check, scan 3 peer orgs, use a free tool (e.g., Hashtagify/RiteTag free) to spot 2–3 emerging tags; update sets.

ACCESSIBILITY CHECKLIST
Use CamelCase; avoid punctuation/special characters; keep tags concise (2–4 words); spell clearly; avoid long strings.

NONPROFIT CONTEXT
Optimize for a small team: clear, defensible choices; easy copy-paste; minimal monitoring burden.
