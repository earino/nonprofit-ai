## The Prompt

```
Write a year-end Annual Fund appeal letter for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to [DONOR SEGMENT] donors that can be used for both print and email.

The appeal letter should:
- Be 325-425 words total, fit on one page, with 4-6 short paragraphs and a 1-2 sentence P.S. restating the ask and urgency.
- Follow this order: [SALUTATION with DONOR FIRST NAME] → Opening story (2-3 sentences) about [BENEFICIARY NAME/COMPOSITE] → Prior support acknowledgment or lapsed re-engagement → Case for unrestricted support → Urgency (match/deadline/goal) → Clear ask with gift string → CTAs → Warm close → [SIGNER NAME, TITLE] → P.S.
- Lead with one vivid, dignity-first story detail; avoid savior language; include [PROGRAM AREA] and [CITY/COMMUNITY] context.
- Make a concrete case for unrestricted support in 2-3 sentences, with examples like [UNRESTRICTED EXAMPLES] (e.g., keep staff on the frontlines, respond to urgent needs, keep doors open).
- Personalize the ask using [LAST GIFT AMOUNT]; propose a three-option string [ASK 1]/[ASK 2]/[ASK 3] (anchor at 1.5–2x last gift) with specific impact notes [IMPACT PER $].
- Create urgency with [MATCH DETAILS] and/or [DEADLINE DATE], reference [YEAR-END GOAL], and a realistic consequence [CONSEQUENCE] if the goal is missed.
- Include bracketed segment lines: [IF LAPSED], [IF CURRENT], [IF MAJOR], [IF MONTHLY], each 1 sentence tailored to that segment.
- Use donor-centric language (aim for a 3:1 “you” to “we” ratio); open with gratitude; be authentic and specific.
- Provide multiple CTAs: donate at [GIVE URL], scan [QR TEXT], or mail to [REPLY ADDRESS]; include a brief note on DAF/stock [ALT WAYS] if relevant.
- Tone [TONE]: FORMAL (suited for board/major donors; polished, restrained), WARM (relational, gracious, community-centered), CASUAL (friendly, conversational, neighborhood vibe). Choose one.
- Keep readability at 6th–8th grade; short sentences; no clichés (“now more than ever”), no jargon, no guilt or pity framing.
- Also provide: Email subject line (5–7 words) and preview text (35–60 chars); signature block for [SIGNER NAME], [TITLE]; optional footer line with [EIN].

A strong letter feels human and mission-true: story first, clear unrestricted case, specific dollar handles, and respectful urgency. Avoid vagueness, stat dumps, or overpromising. The P.S. should repeat the ask and [MATCH/DEADLINE]. Ensure the piece is segment-ready with bracketed variations and includes at least two frictionless ways to give.
