## The Prompt

```
Write a compelling annual fund appeal letter for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to send to
all donors and prospects. The letter should:

- Open with an engaging story or powerful statistic about [KEY ISSUE/PROBLEM]
- Explain the organization's impact this past year: [YEAR'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS]
- Describe the urgent need or opportunity for the coming year
- Present a specific funding goal or program need: [CAMPAIGN GOAL/NEED]
- Include a concrete ask for support at multiple giving levels: [SUGGESTED AMOUNTS]
- Explain what each giving level specifically provides or accomplishes
- Create urgency (year-end, matching gift, deadline) without being manipulative: [URGENCY FACTOR]
- Include emotional appeal that connects to donor values
- Make it personal with direct "you" language
- Provide clear instructions for how to give (online, check, phone)
- Be 350-500 words for direct mail
- Use a [URGENT/HOPEFUL/INSPIRING] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]
- Include P.S. with most compelling point or deadline reminder

The letter should inspire donors to give by showing both need and impact, creating
appropriate urgency, and making them feel their gift will make a tangible difference.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
2. Replace **[KEY ISSUE/PROBLEM]** with the core challenge you address
3. Replace **[YEAR'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS]** with 2-3 specific wins from the past year
4. Replace **[CAMPAIGN GOAL/NEED]** with your fundraising goal or program need
5. Replace **[SUGGESTED AMOUNTS]** with giving levels appropriate for your audience
6. Replace **[URGENCY FACTOR]** with deadline, match, or year-end context

8. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign (ED or Board Chair)

## Pro Tips

1. **Mail early**: Annual fund letters should mail by mid-November for year-end giving
2. **Segment your list**: Different versions for major donors vs. prospects vs. lapsed donors
3. **Test everything**: Subject line, opening story, ask amounts - A/B test what works
4. **Multiple touches**: Plan for 3-4 contacts (mail, email, reminder, final push)
5. **Handwritten notes**: Add handwritten P.S. to top-tier donors
6. **Match the moment**: Reference current events or season if relevant and authentic
7. **Make giving easy**: QR code, reply envelope, multiple payment options
8. **Thank fast**: Pre-plan thank-you process before mailing appeal
