## The Prompt

```
Create a nonprofit-compliant Board Meeting Minutes Template for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that small teams can complete quickly and boards can approve confidently.

The Board Meeting Minutes Template should:
- Begin with a header: [ORGANIZATION NAME], [MEETING TYPE: Regular/Special/Annual], [DATE], [TIME & TIME ZONE], [LOCATION/VIRTUAL LINK], [MEETING CALLED TO ORDER AT], [CHAIR], [SECRETARY], [QUORUM: Yes/No], [CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DISCLOSED: Yes/No].
- List attendance by category: Board (Present/Absent), Staff, Guests; note late arrivals/early departures when relevant.
- Include agenda approval and prior minutes approval (motion, second, vote outcome).
- Capture reports received (title, presenter) and reference attachments: [REPORT NAME] – stored at [FILE PATH/DRIVE LINK]; do not embed content.
- Record motions verbatim with mover/seconder, vote method (voice/roll call), tally (For/Against/Abstain), recusals, and outcome; include decisions made without formal motion if permitted by [BYLAWS REFERENCE].
- Summarize key discussion points in neutral, past tense (2–4 bullets per topic); no verbatim quotes or editorializing.
- Provide an Action Items table: Item, Owner, Due Date, Status; highlight deadlines impacting programs/funders.
- Note Executive Session as a line item with start/end times and general purpose only; no details.
- Include public comment (if applicable) and any declared conflicts of interest or recusals.
- Conclude with adjournment time and next meeting details.
- Add approval/signature block: “Approved by the Board on [DATE]” with lines for [BOARD CHAIR NAME/TITLE] and [SECRETARY NAME/TITLE]; “Prepared by [MINUTE-TAKER NAME/TITLE].”
- Compliance footer: “Draft within [X DAYS, e.g., 7]; retain for [RETENTION PERIOD] per [STATE/BYLAWS].”
- Provide a brief example narrative (250–350 words) using [TONE: FORMAL = precise, legal record; WARM = plain, readable yet compliant; CASUAL = only for internal committees, not recommended for board minutes].

Quality principles: Be specific, factual, and concise. Avoid jargon, opinions, attributions of sensitive remarks, and unnecessary detail. Prioritize motions, decisions, and action owners. Common pitfalls: failing to record vote tallies/recusals, mixing attachments into the body, over-transcribing, and omitting storage locations.
