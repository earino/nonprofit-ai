## The Prompt

```
Create a volunteer recruitment message for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that converts busy people into committed volunteers for [MISSION/CAUSE] on [CHANNEL: EMAIL/LANDING PAGE/INSTAGRAM/LINKEDIN/FLYER].

The message should:
- Start with an impact-forward headline (max 10 words) tied to [MISSION/CAUSE].
- Open with a hook that shows beneficiary impact (not organizational need), citing 1 concrete outcome or stat: [IMPACT METRIC/OUTCOME] benefiting [BENEFICIARY/COMMUNITY].
- Clearly describe the opportunity: [VOLUNTEER ROLE(S)], primary tasks, who it’s ideal for, [TIME COMMITMENT], [SCHEDULE WINDOW], [LOCATION/VIRTUAL], [ACCESSIBILITY/LOGISTICS], training/support provided, and point of contact.
- State a volunteer value proposition for [AUDIENCE SEGMENT] (e.g., skill-building [SKILLS], networking, purpose, family-friendly) using “you” language.
- Address top objections in 1–2 short lines (time, skills, transportation/childcare) and show flexible entry points: [ENTRY OPTIONS: one-time/ongoing/virtual/skilled/group/family].
- Include one authentic 1–2 sentence testimonial with name/role [TESTIMONIAL] (confirm permission implied).
- Add a brief inclusion note that welcomes diverse volunteers and lived experience [DEI MESSAGE]; use plain language (grade 7–9).
- Provide visual guidance: suggest 1–2 photos of real volunteers in action with consent [PHOTO DESCRIPTION].
- End with one clear CTA that combines action + timeframe + link/button [CTA/URL]; include a micro-commitment (e.g., “15‑minute info session”).
- Supply 2 alternative headlines/subject lines and 2 CTA variants for A/B testing.
- Word count: 250–350 words (photo notes and A/B lines do not count).
- Tone: [TONE = FORMAL (for partners/funders; precise, respectful) / WARM (community-centered, encouraging) / CASUAL (youthful, energetic; still professional)].
- Sign as [SIGNER NAME/TITLE] if used for email or letter; omit for social.

Deliver copy that is concrete, specific, and free of jargon and guilt appeals. Avoid clichés (“change the world,” “rockstar”), saviorism, and vague asks. Prioritize clarity (what, where, when, how long), show real impact, and make next steps effortless—so small teams can paste, post, and launch with minimal edits.
