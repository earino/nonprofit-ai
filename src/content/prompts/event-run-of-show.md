## The Prompt

```
Create a detailed Event Run-of-Show Script for [EVENT NAME] hosted by [ORGANIZATION NAME] on [DATE] at [VENUE] for an audience of [AUDIENCE TYPE] with a goal of [PRIMARY GOAL: e.g., fundraising target, stewardship, awareness].

The Run-of-Show should:
- Begin with a 5-line overview: purpose, target attendance [NUMBER], fundraising goal [AMOUNT] (if applicable), key moments (e.g., Fund-a-Need/paddle raise/testimonial/award), and hard stop time.
- Provide a minute-by-minute timeline from [DOORS OPEN TIME] to [END TIME] with: exact time, duration, segment title, on-mic/on-stage person, segment owner (staff/volunteer), AV cues (mics/slides/video/music), materials/props, and accessibility notes.
- Build in at least 10% buffer time; show buffers explicitly and how they’ll be used (e.g., shorten welcome, skip table shout-outs).
- Include MC and transition scripts (natural, not read-y) 60–120 words per segment; write in the voice of [MC NAME/TITLE] with [TONE].
- Script critical moments precisely: [FUNDRAISING MOMENT TYPE], instructions to donors, pledge mechanics, who holds the mic, visual cues, and countdowns.
- Add a concise speaker guide: 90–150 words per speaker’s key points, time limit, and “if over time” cut line.
- Provide an AV/Tech sheet: channel list, mic assignments, slide/video file names and timestamps, music cue names, lighting looks, and GO calls for the show-caller.
- Note catering/service cues: when to pour, serve, clear, and how to avoid clashing with speeches.
- Include staffing grid with call times, roles, cell numbers, and primary comms channel (e.g., text thread/radios).
- Add contingency plans for late speakers, tech failure, weather, and running ±10 minutes; specify who decides cuts/adds.
- Include pronunciation guide for names, accessibility accommodations (ASL, captions, quiet space), and land acknowledgment (if used).
- Deliver a 1-page “At-a-Glance” summary for volunteers and a printable timeline; distribute by [SEND DATE].

Tone options: FORMAL (gala; polished, concise), WARM (community; appreciative, inclusive), CASUAL (festival; friendly, energetic). Author credits: MC [NAME], Show-Caller [NAME], Producer [STAFF LEAD]. Avoid clichés, long bios, jargon, and rushed pacing; keep gratitude tight, directives clear, and transitions humane to respect donors, clients, and volunteers.
