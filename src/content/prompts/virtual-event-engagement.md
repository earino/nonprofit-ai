## The Prompt

```
Create a comprehensive Virtual Event Engagement Strategy and Run-of-Show for [EVENT NAME], a [EVENT TYPE: FUNDRAISING GALA/WORKSHOP/PANEL/TOWN HALL/CELEBRATION] hosted by [ORGANIZATION NAME] on [DATE/TIME/TIME ZONE] for [TARGET AUDIENCE(S)]. Format the output as a [OUTPUT FORMAT: Google Doc outline/Planning spreadsheet columns/Presentation outline/Plain text] with clear headings and bullet points. If any bracketed item is not finalized, use “TBD” and provide general best-practice guidance.

Output Structure: Generate a complete event package including: (1) Strategy overview (450-650 words), (2) Minute-by-minute run-of-show, (3) Scripts and talking points, (4) Technical/production checklist, and (5) Follow-up plan. Elements beyond the strategy overview are supplementary and not counted toward the word limit.

Event Parameters:
- Team size: [TEAM SIZE]
- Budget: [BUDGET RANGE]
- Platform: [ZOOM/TEAMS/WEBEX/OTHER]
- Expected attendance: [EXPECTED ATTENDEE COUNT]
- Speakers/presenters: [NUMBER AND FORMAT]
- Event history: [FIRST-TIME/ANNUAL/RECURRING]

Strategy Overview (450-650 words):
- One-sentence purpose statement
- Three SMART goals tied to mission outcomes (e.g., donor conversions, volunteer sign-ups, policy actions)
- How format and interactive elements support these goals
- Key accessibility and inclusion commitments (captioning/ASL, language access, visual contrast)

Minute-by-Minute Run-of-Show (75–90 minutes total):
- Detailed timeline with time stamps (e.g., 0:00–0:05 Welcome and land acknowledgment)
- Interactive touchpoints every 10–15 minutes (polls, chat prompts, breakouts, reactions, Q&A)
- Mark technical transitions, speaker handoffs, production cues, and buffer time
- Identify fundraising/CTA moments and countdown cues

Platform & Access Details:
- Registration flow and confirmation process (include calendar hold link)
- Donation button/link CTA: [CTA LINK]
- Accessibility: [CAPTIONING/ASL/OTHER NEEDS]; visual descriptions as needed
- Dial-in backup number and instructions
- Recording policy: [WILL RECORD AND SHARE/WILL RECORD FOR INTERNAL USE/NO RECORDING]; post-event access: [RECORDING AVAILABLE TO ALL/ATTENDEES ONLY/NOT AVAILABLE]
- Security settings (waiting room, rename, chat permissions)

Team Roles & Responsibilities:
- Emcee/Host: [EMCEE NAME/TITLE]—on-camera engagement and transitions
- Chat Moderator: curate questions, flag issues, post links
- Tech Lead: platform management, screen shares, troubleshooting, backup plan
- Speaker Wrangler: cues, timing, bios, green-room coordination
- Escalation protocol (3 steps): Tech Lead attempts fix → switch to backup (slides-only/dial-in) → Emcee acknowledges and pivots agenda

Pre-Event Communications:
- Registration confirmation email (100–150 words): event details, calendar hold, what to expect, accessibility info, platform download link
- 24-hour reminder (75–100 words): login link, “test your tech” note, what to have ready, teaser
- 1-hour day-of reminder (≤50 words): direct login link
- Subject lines for each email

Scripts & Talking Points:
- Opening (30–45 sec): welcome, purpose, what to expect
- Inclusive welcome/land acknowledgment (if appropriate)
- Donor/volunteer acknowledgment (20–30 sec): concise gratitude without long lists
- Mission story (60–90 sec): vivid, specific, outcome-tied narrative
- Closing (30–45 sec): thanks, next steps, clear CTAs

Interactive Elements:
- Polls: 2–3 multiple-choice questions (3–5 options each), timed with purpose noted (e.g., Poll 1 at 15:00 to gauge familiarity)
- Chat prompts: 3–5 exact questions (e.g., “Share your city,” “One action you’ll take this week?”)
- Breakout (optional, 5–7 min): clear prompt, roles, time warning, debrief plan
- Q&A flow: how to submit, moderation rules, time limits, spam/troll handling (mute/remove, chat limits)

Fundraising Moment:
- 90-sec story: who/what funds support and impact
- Specific ask: [FUNDRAISING GOAL] with tiers (e.g., $50 does X, $100 does Y)
- On-screen CTA with exact language and [CTA LINK]; note match if applicable [MATCH DETAILS or N/A]
- Plan B soft ask (≤30 sec) if short on time; follow-up giving instructions

Production Checklist:
- Audio: mic test, backup source, mute protocols
- Lighting/background: high contrast, quiet space, branded or neutral backdrop
- Slides: branded, large fonts (24pt+), high contrast, minimal text
- Accessibility: alt text for images in posted materials, captions/ASL integration
- Speaker tech checks (24–48 hrs prior): audio/video, screen share, backup slides, run-through
- Screen share permissions; backup deck with Tech Lead

Follow-Up Plan (within 48 hours):
- Segmented emails:
  - Attendees (150–200 words): thanks, recording link, survey, donation/next-step CTAs
  - No-shows (100–150 words): we missed you, recording, next opportunity
  - New donors (100–150 words): gratitude, impact, what’s next
- Survey (max 5 questions): overall rating, most valuable element, tech issues, future topics, likelihood to attend again
- Next-step CTAs by segment; 2–3 social recap posts with sample copy

Success Metrics (define targets):
- Registration-to-attendance conversion rate (target: [X]%)
- Retention rate: percentage who stay through the full event (target: [X]%)
- Engagement rate: percentage participating in polls/chat (target: [X]%)
- Q&A participation: questions submitted (target: [X])
- Donation/pledge conversions: percentage and dollars (target: [X]% / $[X])
- Survey response rate (target: [X]%)
- Post-event actions: clicks/sign-ups/shares (target: [X])

Tone & Voice:
Use [TONE: FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL] throughout. Attribute all host voice to [EMCEE NAME/TITLE] speaking directly to attendees.

Quality Standards:
- Concrete, copy-paste-ready guidance; natural, spoken-friendly scripts
- Realistic timings for small teams; interaction combats fatigue
- Accessibility built-in; CTAs specific and easy to act on

Avoid:
- Generic corporate language, long monologues (>2 min), filler phrases
- Technical jargon without explanation or complex platform admin steps
- Specialized A/V requirements beyond a basic laptop/webcam setup
- Overly ambitious timelines that create unnecessary stress
