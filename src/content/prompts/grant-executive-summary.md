STEP 3: CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (GENERATE THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY)

- Define acronyms on first use
- Use active voice; plain language; avoid jargon and superlatives
- Output as formatted text ready to paste into a Word document (clear section breaks)
- Adjust sections based on funder RFP; if space is tight, prioritize: Need → Solution → Request → Outcomes → Capacity

Content Priorities:
1) Need (1–2 sentences): Name the community, scale of need, who is most affected, and specific impact. Be concrete and local.
2) Solution (2–3 sentences): What will be done, for whom, where, and how many will be served; include delivery model and key partners.
3) Request (1–2 sentences): State prominently: [AMOUNT] for [PURPOSE] over [TIMEFRAME]; include total budget, confirmed/matching funds, and per-participant cost if relevant.
4) Outcomes (2–3 sentences): Provide 3–5 measurable outcomes with targets and timing.
5) Evidence & Evaluation (1–2 sentences): Cite prior results or research and how results will be tracked.
6) Organizational Capacity (1–2 sentences): Track record, staffing/governance, fiscal health.

9) Timeline (1 sentence or short list): 3–4 milestones.
10) Sustainability (1 sentence): How work continues after the grant.
11) Contact (1 line): Brief invitation + contact details; include signer only if required.

Quality Standards:
DO:
- Be concrete and numeric (e.g., “served 450 families,” “92% retained housing”)
- Use funder’s priority language (accurately, 1–2 times)
- Lead with impact; make every sentence advance need, solution, or evidence
- Use specific place names and populations
- Keep paragraphs tight and focused

DON’T:
- Use clichés (“transformational,” “world-class,” “cutting-edge,” “game-changing”)
- Restate your mission statement
- Introduce ideas not in the full proposal
- Use undefined acronyms or jargon
- Make vague claims without data
- Write in passive voice
- Exceed 400 words

EXAMPLE SNIPPET (Need + Solution opening):
