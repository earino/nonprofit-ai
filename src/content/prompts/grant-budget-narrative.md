## The Prompt

```
Draft a grant budget narrative for [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [PROGRAM NAME] to submit to [FUNDER NAME], aligning precisely with the program description and [FUNDER BUDGET CATEGORIES/ORDER] for the [GRANT PERIOD].

The budget narrative should:
- Stay within 350-550 words and mirror [FUNDER BUDGET CATEGORIES/ORDER] exactly, using the same headings.
- Open with a 1-2 sentence summary: total request [REQUEST AMOUNT], total program budget [TOTAL PROGRAM BUDGET], participants served [NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS], and key outcomes [KEY OUTCOMES].
- For Personnel: list each role with FTE, duties tied to [KEY ACTIVITIES LIST], salary basis, and math (e.g., “0.50 FTE Program Manager at $[ANNUAL SALARY] = $[AMOUNT]”).
- For Fringe: state [FRINGE RATE %], what it covers, and apply to the correct base.
- For Non-Personnel: justify each item with unit x quantity x months and program link (e.g., “[UNIT COST EXAMPLES]”).
- For Shared/Allocated costs: explain [ALLOCATION METHOD] (e.g., by FTE, sq. ft., participant count) and why it’s fair.
- For Indirect/Admin: state [INDIRECT RATE %] and base [INDIRECT BASE: MTDC/TDC], give a brief rationale (e.g., audited rate, historical awards), and clarify what is included to avoid double-charging.
- For Match/Cost Share: indicate [MATCH REQUIREMENT %/AMOUNT], sources [MATCH SOURCES (cash/in-kind)], status (committed/pending), and in-kind valuation method (note 2 CFR 200 if federal).
- Include cost-effectiveness: cost per participant and, if possible, cost per outcome.
- Note key assumptions and exclusions [CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS] and confirm totals equal [REQUEST AMOUNT] and align with the budget table.
- Address sustainability: how costs will be maintained or decrease post-grant.
- Cite allowability/compliance notes or link: [ALLOWABILITY NOTES or LINK].
- Tone options: [TONE] = FORMAL (government/foundation; precise, neutral), WARM (foundation/community; accessible, confident), CASUAL (internal drafting only; plain).
- Closing line: “Prepared by [AUTHOR NAME, TITLE].”

Deliver concrete justifications, plain language, and transparent math. Avoid clichés (“transformational”), vague labels (“miscellaneous,” “overhead”), or unexplained percentages. Every dollar requested should connect to planned activities and outcomes, match the funder’s categories, and pass a quick calculator check to prevent math errors that can sink proposals.
