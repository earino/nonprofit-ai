- [ ] Author/role, date, and contact info for sign-off
- [ ] Pivotal section/page in the report to highlight

If any required item is missing, ask me for it before drafting.

How to provide your report:
- Best: Paste the full report text below.
- If too long for this chat: paste a 200–400 word synopsis plus the Key Findings and Recommendations sections, and copy any tables/charts with numbers. Include a shareable link to the full report if available.
- If still too long, we can iterate: first share the table of contents and a 1–page summary; then share data tables and methods; then share findings and recommendations.


YOUR PROMPT

Using the report content provided, draft a standalone executive summary for [ORGANIZATION NAME]’s [REPORT TITLE], tailored to [PRIMARY AUDIENCE] [and relevant for SECONDARY AUDIENCES if provided].

Critical context: The primary decision or action needed is: [DECISION NEEDED].

Format & length:
- 500–800 words (1–2 pages), skimmable, with clear subheadings
- Fully comprehensible WITHOUT reading the full report—assume readers may never see it
- The first 150 words must state the core insight and the decision ask

Required sections (use this exact order and headings; suggested lengths are guides):
1) Executive Headline (2–3 sentences; ~40–70 words)
   - Lead with what matters most to [PRIMARY AUDIENCE] and state the decision/action needed upfront.
   - Example: “Board approval of a $50,000 bridge grant in Q2 will sustain 18 weekly food deliveries for 420 seniors while federal funds are delayed. Without this, routes serving Southside (n=156 seniors) will pause by June 15.”

2) Purpose & Context (1–2 sentences; ~25–45 words)
   - Why this matters now to [COMMUNITY/ISSUE]; scope ([PROGRAM AREA], [GEOGRAPHY], timeframe); intended outcomes if provided.

3) Key Findings (3–5 bullets; ~130–170 words total)
   - Use concrete data with absolute numbers, % change, and sample sizes.
   - Use parallel structure and note equity insights/disaggregated results when relevant.
   - Example bullet: “Service volume grew to 1,284 visits in FY2024 (+22% vs. FY2023; n=1,284), driven by first-time clients (+37%; n=418), with fastest growth among youth ages 16–24 (+41%).”
   - Data Spotlight (1–2 sentences): Include one critical stat or a caption-ready chart description (e.g., “Figure 2: Enrollment increased 28% (n=412) from 2022–2024, with the largest gains among Latinx youth (+45%).”).

4) Recommendations (3–5 prioritized, feasible actions; ~180–260 words total)
   - For each: specific action; owner [ROLE]; timeline (0–3, 3–6, 6–12 months); rough resources (staff time/$), feasible for [TEAM SIZE]/[BUDGET CONSTRAINT] if provided, otherwise assume a small team and tight budget.
   - Mark the top recommendation as “Priority 1.”

5) Next Steps & Decision Asks (2–4 bullets; ~60–100 words)
   - Who does what by when, e.g., “Board votes on bridge funding by May 15.”

6) Risks & Limitations (~60–100 words)
   - Key assumptions, data gaps [LIMITATIONS if provided], and mitigation steps. Do not invent data; label as “N/A” if not available.

7) Resource Implications (2–3 sentences; ~40–70 words)
   - Budget, staff time, and other resources required; note tradeoffs.

8) Data Sources & Methods (1–2 sentences; ~30–50 words)
   - Data sources, timeframe, sample sizes, and critical methodological notes.

9) Contact & Next Reading (1–2 sentences; ~20–40 words)
   - Sign-off: “Prepared by [AUTHOR/ROLE], [DATE], [CONTACT].”
   - End with a 1-sentence teaser pointing readers to a pivotal section/page (e.g., “For option analysis, see Section 3, pp. 14–17.”)

Tone & style:
- Tone: [FORMAL / WARM / CASUAL]. Default to FORMAL if not specified.
- Plain language (8th–10th grade reading level); short sentences and active voice.
- Define all acronyms at first use (e.g., “community-based organization (CBO)”).
- Use commas in numbers over 999 (e.g., 1,247). Round percentages sensibly (0 or 1 decimal if needed).
- Use $ for currency (e.g., $50,000); round to the nearest $1,000 unless precision matters.
- Never use: leverage, synergy, paradigm shift, world-class, impactful, utilize (say “use”), stakeholder (name the group).
- This is not a table of contents; it must tell the complete story clearly and briefly.

Quality standards:
- Prioritize must-know insights over background.
- Verify all numbers and names match the report; include sample sizes where relevant.
- Ensure each recommendation is actionable with clear ownership, timing, and rough cost.
- Ensure a busy executive can read in 3 minutes and make the decision.
- If information is missing or unclear, flag it, propose how to fill the gap, and avoid assumptions.

PASTE YOUR REPORT CONTENT BELOW
[Paste full report text, or synopsis plus key sections. Include links and copied tables/charts as needed.]

AFTER GENERATION — QUICK CHECK
- [ ] Are all numbers accurate, sourced, and formatted consistently?
- [ ] Is the decision ask explicit in the first 150 words?
- [ ] Are recommendations feasible for our team size and budget?
- [ ] Could someone who hasn’t seen the report understand this fully?
- [ ] Do risks/limitations and mitigations appear clearly and honestly?
