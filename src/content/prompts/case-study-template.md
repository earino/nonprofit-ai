## The Prompt

```
Draft a grant-ready nonprofit case study for [ORGANIZATION NAME] about [PROGRAM/PROJECT] in [GEOGRAPHY] during [TIMEFRAME], serving [TARGET POPULATION], intended for [INTENDED AUDIENCE].

The case study should:
- Be 900–1,200 words plus 3–6 citations/links.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (precise, evidence-forward for funders), WARM (human-centered yet factual for donors/volunteers), or PROFESSIONAL (balanced, plain-language for practitioners/policymakers).
- Follow this structure in order: 1) Executive Summary (3–5 bullet highlights), 2) Context/Challenge (need, baseline, equity considerations), 3) Intervention (what we did, dosage, timeline, staffing, [KEY PARTNERS], [BUDGET] range), 4) Methodology (design, [DATA SOURCES], sample size, measures, comparison/baseline, consent & privacy steps), 5) Results (outputs and outcomes with concrete metrics; compare to baseline/targets), 6) Analysis (why it worked; alignment with relevant research), 7) Lessons Learned & Limitations, 8) Next Steps & Funding Needs, 9) Citations & Acknowledgments.
- Include concrete numbers (n, %, change over time); clearly distinguish correlation vs. causation.
- Add one short client vignette (2–3 sentences) using a pseudonym and [CONSENT NOTE]; do not include PII.
- Propose 1–2 visuals (e.g., bar chart of outcome change, funnel of service flow) and 1 photo concept with required consent language.
- Use accessible language (define acronyms, 9th–10th grade reading level); avoid clichés and buzzwords.
- Note any data gaps or assumptions as [DATA NEEDED] and recommend minimal follow-ups to program staff.
- Include 1–2 pull-quote or stat callouts for reuse in grants/marketing.
- Author line: By [AUTHOR NAME/TITLE]. Reviewed by [APPROVER NAME/TITLE].

A strong case study is specific, transparent, and replicable: cite sources, state methods, and name limitations without overstating impact. Avoid savior language, jargon, or unverifiable claims. Use this format for grant appendices, impact pages, donor reports, and board packets; it balances rigor with readability for small teams.
