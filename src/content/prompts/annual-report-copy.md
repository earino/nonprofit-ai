## The Prompt

```
Draft an Executive Director's Executive Summary for [ORGANIZATION NAME]'s [YEAR] Annual Report.

Structure & Flow: The summary should flow naturally from hook → mission context → accomplishments → challenges → gratitude → finances → future priorities → CTA. Weave in the quote and formatting cues where they strengthen the narrative. Format as a single continuous document with paragraph breaks (not bulleted lists). Use subheadings sparingly or not at all.

The executive summary should:
- Length & Voice: 450–600 words at [READING LEVEL: 8th/10th grade], written authentically in the ED's voice.
- Opening Hook: Begin with 1–2 sentences reflecting the year's theme/defining moment: [YEAR THEME]. Make it specific and vivid—avoid clichés like "challenging year" or "unprecedented times."
- Mission Context: Reaffirm mission in plain language (who/where/why): [MISSION/FOCUS] in [GEOGRAPHY]. Ground readers in your purpose.
- Accomplishments: Highlight 3–5 key accomplishments with concrete, verifiable metrics: [ACCOMPLISHMENTS + METRICS]. Tie each to strategy and community impact. Metrics should be specific (e.g., "340 families housed" not "many families helped"; "18% increase in graduation rates" not "improved outcomes").
- Challenges & Learning: Acknowledge 1–2 key challenges or pivots: [CHALLENGES] and what was learned or changed as a result. Show adaptability and honesty.
- Gratitude: Thank supporters (donors, funders, volunteers, partners), quantifying support where possible: [SUPPORTER DATA]. Be specific and genuine.
- Financial Transparency: Provide a clear financial headline (not a full report): [REVENUE], [EXPENSES], [PROGRAM %], [AUDIT/990 STATUS], and stewardship stance. Keep to one concise paragraph.
- Community Voice: Include one brief quote from a community member or partner (1–2 sentences): [QUOTE + ATTRIBUTION]. Place it where it amplifies impact.
- Future Focus: Look ahead with 2–3 focused priorities for next year and what support enables them: [PRIORITIES]. Be concrete about what's next.
- Call to Action: Close with a modest, clear CTA (read full report, subscribe, attend event): [CTA/LINKS].
- Signature: Sign off with [SIGNATORY NAME, TITLE]. Note "Headshot here" with alt text: [HEADSHOT ALT TEXT]. Alt text should describe the person professionally (e.g., "Maria Rodriguez, Executive Director, smiling in front of community garden").
- Formatting for Design: Tag callouts as [SIDEBAR], charts as [CHART]. Identify 3–5 pull-quote candidates from the text (8–15 words each, emotionally resonant or data-driven) and mark them with [PULL QUOTE].

Tone: [TONE = FORMAL (board/funders, precise, restrained) / WARM (donors/community, appreciative, conversational) / CASUAL (youth-forward, plainspoken, still professional)].

Consistency Check: Ensure this year's message builds on (not repeats) last year's: [LAST YEAR THEME]. Show progression and evolution.

Quality Standards: Be specific, humble, and credible. Avoid jargon, saviorism, deficit framing, hype, and phrases like "unprecedented" or "now more than ever." Use active voice, people-first language, and numbers that can be verified. Write something a small team can publish with minimal edits and that reads well to donors, funders, partners, volunteers, and community members.
