## The Prompt

```
Write a segmented, post-event thank-you email for [ORGANIZATION NAME] to send within 48–72 hours after [EVENT NAME] on [EVENT DATE].

The post-event thank-you email should:
- Produce separate versions for selected segments: [SPONSORS/DONORS OR TICKET BUYERS/VOLUNTEERS/GUESTS OR COMMUNITY PARTNERS]. If [SEGMENTS] not specified, create all four.
- Include for each segment: Subject line (6–9 words) and preview text (35–55 characters) optimized for opens.
- Open with a personalized salutation using [FIRST NAME] and a specific thank-you tied to their role (e.g., “for sponsoring,” “for attending,” “for volunteering the [HOURS] hours,” “for purchasing a ticket”).
- Share an “impact snapshot” with 2–3 concrete outcomes from the event using placeholders where needed: [DOLLARS RAISED], [ATTENDEES], [PROGRAM IMPACT METRIC], [QUOTE OR 1-LINE TESTIMONIAL].
- Highlight one memorable moment from the event: [HIGHLIGHT MOMENT], and include 1–2 photo links with descriptive alt text: [PHOTO 1 DESCRIPTION – LINK], [PHOTO 2 DESCRIPTION – LINK].
- Thank sponsors prominently. For the sponsor segment, lead with impact tied to their support and include a sponsor benefits nod or next-step debrief: [SPONSOR DEBRIEF LINK]. For non-sponsors, include a brief “Thanks to [TOP SPONSOR NAME(S)]” line.
- Include gentle, stewardship-first next steps (no hard ask): [SURVEY LINK], [ALBUM LINK], [NEXT EVENT SAVE-THE-DATE], and one optional soft pathway tailored by segment (e.g., [VOLUNTEER LINK], [DONATE LINK – OPTIONAL], [NEWSLETTER LINK]).
- Note any follow-up commitments made at the event (e.g., receipts, slides, photos) and when they’ll arrive: [FOLLOW-UP ITEM] by [DATE].
- Keep structure scannable: 2–3 short paragraphs plus a 2–3 bullet impact list; reading level 6th–8th grade; mobile-friendly lines under ~75 characters.
- Word count per segment: 150–220 words.
- Tone: [TONE] = FORMAL (corporate/funders; polished, concise), WARM (default; human, appreciative, mission-forward), CASUAL (volunteers/young audiences; friendly, simple). Keep consistent throughout.
- Sign off personally from [SIGNER NAME], [TITLE] (preferably Executive Director or Event Chair), with an optional brief P.S. reinforcing one next step.

Aim for concrete, human, and specific. Avoid clichés (“game-changer,” “on behalf of”), jargon, or multiple exclamation points. Do not include a big, urgent ask—stewardship first. Link to assets instead of attaching files. Use inclusive language that centers the community you serve and double-check all placeholders for accuracy before sending.
