## The Prompt

```
Write a heartfelt thank-you letter for a mid-level donor who gave $[AMOUNT] to
[ORGANIZATION NAME]. The letter should:

- Express genuine appreciation for their significant support
- Acknowledge if this is an upgrade from their previous giving level
- Explain the specific, meaningful impact of their $[AMOUNT] gift
- Make them feel like a valued member of the organization's community
- Reference the campaign or program they supported: [CAMPAIGN/PROGRAM NAME]
- Include a personal touch that shows you know who they are
- Invite them to stay connected (newsletter, updates, etc.)
- Be 250-350 words in length
- Use a [FORMAL/WARM/PROFESSIONAL] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should acknowledge that this is a substantial gift that makes a real
difference, without being over-the-top. Make the donor feel appreciated and
important to the organization's mission. No immediate ask for another donation.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[AMOUNT]** with the donation amount ($100-$999)
2. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
3. Replace **[CAMPAIGN/PROGRAM NAME]** with what they supported
4. Replace **[FORMAL/WARM/PROFESSIONAL]** with your preferred tone
5. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign
6. Optional: Add specific details about their donor history if you know it (e.g., "This is your third year supporting us" or "You've increased your giving this year")

## Pro Tips

1. **Check donor history**: If they upgraded from a smaller gift, acknowledge it specifically
2. **Be specific about impact**: Mid-level donors want to know their gift matters - use concrete examples
3. **Personal touch**: Reference if they attended an event, volunteered, or have other connections
4. **Timeline matters**: Send within 48-72 hours while gift is fresh in their mind
5. **Leadership signature**: Mid-level gifts warrant signature from ED or Board Chair
6. **Future stewardship**: Mention you'll keep them updated on impact (sets expectation for future contact)
