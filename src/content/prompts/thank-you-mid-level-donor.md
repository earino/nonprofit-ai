## The Prompt

```
Create a personalized mid-level donor thank-you letter that a small nonprofit can send quickly while still feeling bespoke.

The thank-you letter should:
- Use these inputs: [ORGANIZATION NAME], [MISSION STATEMENT (1 sentence)], [DONOR NAME], [AMOUNT], [GIFT DATE], [PREVIOUS GIFT AMOUNT/DATE or “N/A”], [YEARS GIVING], [DONOR INTEREST AREA], [PROGRAM/IMPACT EXAMPLE], [IMPACT UNIT + COST (e.g., “$50 = one counseling session”)], [CITY/REGION], [NEXT TOUCHPOINT (e.g., program tour date/report month/event invite)], [FORMAT: LETTER/EMAIL], [TONE], [SIGNER NAME], [SIGNER TITLE], [PREFERRED SIGN-OFF].
- Length: 200–300 words for the main letter.
- Tone options [TONE]: FORMAL (polished, restrained), WARM (professional and personable—default), CASUAL (conversational, friendly).
- If [FORMAT: EMAIL], include a 4–7 word subject line; if LETTER, omit subject.
- Follow this order: salutation; immediate thanks with [AMOUNT] and [GIFT DATE]; acknowledge upgrade and/or [YEARS GIVING]; 1–2 concrete impact sentences tied to [PROGRAM/IMPACT EXAMPLE] and simple math using [IMPACT UNIT + COST]; brief mission alignment; authentic human detail (no client identifiers if sensitive); mention [NEXT TOUCHPOINT] without asking for money; invitation to connect; closing and signature.
- Make it donor-centered (use “you/your” more than “we/our”); plain language (grade 7–9 readability).
- Localize with [CITY/REGION] if provided.
- Include an optional P.S. that reinforces impact or the upcoming touchpoint (no solicitation).
- Provide a 1–2 sentence phone call script for a follow-up within 1 week.
- Provide a 1–2 sentence handwritten note version for card/enclosure.
- Avoid clichés (“valued partner,” “make a difference”), jargon, guilt or savior language, passive voice, multiple exclamation points, and any links or asks.

Quality bar: Specific, accurate, and human. Double-check names, amounts, dates, and impact math. Mid-level donors must feel seen: reference their history, show tangible outcomes at their giving level, and clearly signal the next touchpoint—without turning this into another ask.
