## The Prompt

```
Create mobile-first website homepage copy for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that converts visitors within 5–10 seconds and serves donors, beneficiaries, volunteers, and partners.

The homepage copy should:
- Open with a hero: H1 (8–12 words), subhead (1 sentence stating who you serve and how using [ONE-LINE MISSION]/[PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES]/[GEOGRAPHY]), and three CTAs above the fold with labels and URLs: [TOP CTA URLS] (defaults: Donate, Get Help, Learn More).
- Use this order: Mission (25–40 words) → Impact (1–2 specific stats from [IMPACT STATS] + 1 proof sentence) → Programs (3 benefit-focused bullets, 6–12 words each, with [PROGRAM LINKS]) → Get Involved (donate/volunteer/partner/newsletter microcopy + buttons) → For Those We Serve (1–2 sentences on eligibility + [HELP CONTACT]) → Testimonial (1–2 sentences from [TESTIMONIAL OR QUOTE]).
- Include a short board-safe tagline under the logo using [ONE-LINE MISSION].
- Provide SEO: H1/H2s using [PRIMARY KEYWORDS] and [SECONDARY KEYWORDS]; 1–2 internal links; meta title (55–60 chars) and meta description (140–160 chars).
- Be scannable: total 300–500 words; above-the-fold 50–80 words; paragraphs 1–2 sentences; clear headings.
- Voice/tone: [TONE]= FORMAL (policy/funder-ready), WARM (approachable, inspiring), CASUAL (friendly, community-first). Follow [BRAND VOICE NOTES].
- Accessibility: grade 6–8 reading level; define acronyms on first use; inclusive, plain language; 2 alt-text suggestions (hero and impact image). Consider [ACCESSIBILITY NOTES].
- Provide two A/B hero headline + subhead options.
- Default CTA labels if missing; include placeholders for any missing URLs or data.
- Add footer microcopy: [EIN/LEGAL LINE] and concise contact snippet.
- No byline or individual author.

Prioritize concrete benefits, numbers, and clarity over slogans. Avoid jargon, guilt/framing that centers donors over community, clichés (“changing the world”), and vague claims. Write for real people on mobile screens, balancing SEO with readability and dignity-first storytelling.
