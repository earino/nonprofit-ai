YOUR PROMPT:
Draft an Employee Handbook Section for [ORGANIZATION NAME] on [SECTION TOPIC], aligned with our mission ([MISSION/PROGRAM CONTEXT]) and compliant with [JURISDICTIONS] law. This is for a small nonprofit team with [CAPACITY NOTES].

Formatting Rules:
- Use numbered section headers (1–13) with the exact titles below.
- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists where helpful.
- Procedures must be a numbered checklist with who/what/when and named forms/tools.

3. Purpose/Values Link – 1–2 sentences tying to our mission
4. Scope/Eligibility – Specify:
   - Staff types: [STAFF TYPES]
   - Union status: [UNION STATUS]
   - Work modes: [WORK MODES]
   - Volunteers/contractors: included or excluded
5. Definitions – 3–5 plain-language terms
6. Procedures – Numbered steps with WHO does WHAT by WHEN; include forms/tools; realistic for [CAPACITY NOTES]
7. Legal/Compliance References – Name relevant [JURISDICTIONS] laws/regulations; note when local law supersedes this policy
8. Exceptions & Accommodations – How to request disability/religious accommodations; Contact: [CONTACT ROLE]; response timeframe (e.g., within 5 business days)
9. Reporting/Confidentiality/Anti‑retaliation – Reporting channels; privacy limits; anti-retaliation; recordkeeping and retention timeframes (or “per local law”)

13. Employee Acknowledgment – 30–60 words employees can sign

Content Requirements:
- Length: [WORD COUNT RANGE]
- Tone: [TONE] (use the style demonstrated in the examples above)
- Reading Level: [READING LEVEL]
- Include 1–2 brief nonprofit scenarios (e.g., outreach coordinator at a mobile pantry; program manager on a grant-funded event day)
- Stands Alone: The section must be understandable without reading other sections; cross-references are allowed but not required for basic comprehension.
- Language: plain, specific, enforceable; avoid legalese, vague timelines, and corporate jargon.
- Equity & Accessibility: note [LANGUAGE ACCESS]; include accommodations; ensure fairness across roles and work modes.

What to AVOID:
- Unenforceable promises (“we will always…”)
- Copying statutes verbatim
- Vague timelines (“soon,” “promptly”)
- Procedures requiring tools/staff we don’t have
- Conflicts with union collective bargaining agreements (if any)

Final Elements:
- Authorship Line: “Prepared by [PREPARED BY] | Approved by [APPROVED BY] | Legal review: [LEGAL REVIEW]”
- Equity Note: Flag any potential disparate impacts and how this policy mitigates them.
- Review-Ready: Draft must be suitable for board and legal review with minimal edits.

QUALITY CHECK (Review AI Output Against These):
- Too legalistic? → “Rewrite Procedures in simpler language at [READING LEVEL] with shorter sentences.”
- Too vague? → “Make the Policy Statement specific. Replace vague phrases with concrete timeframes or criteria.”
- Procedures too complex for small team? → “Simplify Procedures for [CAPACITY NOTES]. Reduce steps/forms.”
- Missing nonprofit context? → “Add one example for [specific role] during [specific program activity].”
- Tone off? → “Adjust the tone to be more [WARM/FORMAL/CASUAL] throughout, especially Procedures and Acknowledgment.”
- Contradicts existing policy or law? → “Reconcile with our [OTHER POLICY] and [JURISDICTIONS] law; revise for consistency.”
- Length off-target? → “Resize to [WORD COUNT RANGE] without losing required sections.”
- Union considerations missing? → “Add language acknowledging the CBA and that the CBA governs where different.”
