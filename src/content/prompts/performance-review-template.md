## The Prompt

```
Create a fillable, nonprofit-specific Performance Review Template for [ORGANIZATION NAME], used by [EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR/OPERATIONS COORDINATOR] for [REVIEW PERIOD] reviews across roles (programs, development, operations, volunteer coordination).

The Performance Review Template should:
- Open with 80-100 words of instructions emphasizing developmental intent, equity, confidentiality, and a 60-minute discussion requirement.
- Follow this order: Employee Info; Role Summary; Review of Last Year’s Goals; Competency Ratings; Strengths & Impact; Development Areas; Next-Period SMART Goals; Support & Resources; Overall Rating; Compensation/Recognition Summary; Signatures & Dates; 90-Day Check-In Plan (for new hires).
- Use a 3-point scale with behavioral anchors: Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Developing. Tie to nonprofit indicators (e.g., donor stewardship quality, grant/report timeliness, program outcomes, community partnership, fiscal stewardship, DEI practice, collaboration).
- Include mirrored Self-Assessment prompts for each section with space for 100-150 words and evidence fields (data, dates, stakeholder feedback).
- Limit competencies to 3-5 aligned to [VALUES/COMPETENCIES]; provide sample anchors relevant to [MISSION AREA].
- Require review of 3-5 prior goals (status, results, lessons) and creation of 3-5 new SMART goals with measures, deadlines, and low-cost supports (training, mentoring, schedule adjustments).
- Add a Development Plan (2-3 actions, owner, timeline) and Manager Support commitments tailored to small-team capacity.
- Provide a Compensation/Recognition section aligned to [RAISE POLICY] and budget limits; list non-monetary options (title refinement, flexible schedule, PD stipend, conference speaking, public recognition).
- Include signature lines: Employee, Supervisor, [ED/HR], plus acknowledgement of receipt and 90-day follow-up date.
- Length: 500-700 words of template text, with clear fillable fields and prompts.
- Tone options: [FORMAL] policy-aligned and precise; [WARM] supportive and plain-language; [CASUAL] friendly while professional.
- Prepared by [SUPERVISOR TITLE]; co-authored by [EMPLOYEE NAME]; reviewed by [ED/HR].

Quality: Be concrete and evidence-based; avoid vague adjectives, corporate jargon, or punitive language. Prioritize clarity, equity, and documentation that protects the organization while advancing staff growth.
