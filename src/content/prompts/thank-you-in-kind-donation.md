## The Prompt

```
Draft a donor-ready thank you letter acknowledging an in-kind (non-cash) gift for [ORGANIZATION NAME].

The letter should:
- Be 150-250 words in 2-4 short paragraphs, suitable for email or print on letterhead.
- Follow this order: 1) Warm opening with donor name, 2) Specific gift details, 3) Immediate use and impact, 4) IRS-compliant receipt language, 5) Next step/invitation, 6) Close/signature.
- Name the gift precisely: [GIFT DESCRIPTION], [QUANTITY/SPECS/BRAND], received on [GIFT DATE]. If the donor provided a value, include: “Your stated fair market value: [DONOR-STATED VALUE].” Otherwise omit any dollar amount.
- Explain immediate use: [PROGRAM/DEPARTMENT], and a concrete outcome (e.g., “[PEOPLE SERVED],” “[HOURS OF SERVICE ENABLED],” or “[COSTS AVOIDED]”).
- Tie impact to mission in one sentence: [MISSION ONE-LINER].
- Include IRS receipt language: “No goods or services were provided in exchange for this contribution. [ORGANIZATION NAME] does not assign a monetary value to in-kind gifts. Date received: [GIFT DATE]. EIN: [EIN].”
- Acknowledge volunteer time separately if applicable: “[HOURS] volunteer hours on [DATE] (not tax-deductible) meaningfully advanced this effort.”
- Offer a relationship next step (tour, brief update, or recognition with consent): “With your permission, we’ll recognize you as [RECOGNITION NAME].”
- Use [TONE: FORMAL (board-appropriate), WARM (friendly, professional), CASUAL (conversational, community vibe)] at a 6th–8th grade reading level.
- Close with contact info and signature: [CONTACT NAME/TITLE], [EMAIL], [PHONE]; signed by [SIGNER NAME], [TITLE].

Keep it concrete and donor-centric; avoid clichés (“priceless,” “game-changer”), jargon, or tax advice. Do not invent values; omit any field you don’t have. Match the warmth you’d use for a cash gift while keeping compliance language clear and concise.
