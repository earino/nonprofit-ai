- Express sincere appreciation for their generosity
- Describe specifically what was donated: [DETAILED DESCRIPTION]
- Explain how the donation will be used and its impact on programs/operations
- Acknowledge the value and thoughtfulness of the contribution
- Make them feel their non-monetary gift is just as important as cash
- Reference any relevant context: [CAMPAIGN/EVENT/PROGRAM]
- Include estimated fair market value if known: [ESTIMATED VALUE]
- Mention tax-deductibility and that formal receipt is attached/enclosed
- Invite them to see the donation in action if applicable
- Be 200-300 words
- Use a [WARM/APPRECIATIVE/PROFESSIONAL] tone
- Be signed by [SIGNER NAME and TITLE]

The letter should value in-kind gifts equally to monetary donations and make the
donor feel their contribution directly supports the mission.
```

## How to Customize

1. Replace **[DONATED ITEMS/SERVICES]** with general description (e.g., "furniture", "printing services", "catering")
2. Replace **[DETAILED DESCRIPTION]** with specifics (e.g., "20 office chairs and 5 desks")
3. Replace **[ORGANIZATION NAME]** with your nonprofit's name
4. Replace **[CAMPAIGN/EVENT/PROGRAM]** with relevant context
5. Replace **[ESTIMATED VALUE]** with fair market value if you've assessed it
6. Replace **[WARM/APPRECIATIVE/PROFESSIONAL]** with tone
7. Replace **[SIGNER NAME and TITLE]** with who should sign
8. Add details about how you'll use the donation

## Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: Name exactly what was donated - shows you value and noticed it
2. **Fair market value**: Include if you've assessed it (required for donor's tax deduction)
3. **IRS compliance**: Attach formal receipt with FMV for goods over $250
4. **Show it in use**: Take photo of donated items being used, send to donor
5. **Equal treatment**: Don't make in-kind donors feel like "second-class" compared to cash donors
6. **Acknowledge effort**: If they delivered/installed/set up, thank them for time and labor too
7. **Connect to mission**: Explain how this specific donation advances your programs
