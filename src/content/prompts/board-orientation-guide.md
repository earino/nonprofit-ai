## The Prompt

```
Create a Board Orientation Guide Outline tailored to [ORGANIZATION NAME] that activates new directors within their first 30 days while respecting small-team capacity.

The Board Orientation Guide Outline should:
- Begin with a 2–3 sentence Welcome/Purpose and specify [TONE: FORMAL (compliance-forward), WARM (mission-forward, welcoming), or CASUAL (peer-to-peer, approachable)].
- Use this order and headings with brief content notes: 1) Mission & History; 2) Who We Serve & Programs; 3) Current Strategic Priorities; 4) Governance Basics & Fiduciary Duties (care, loyalty, obedience); 5) Board Structure & Roles; 6) Expectations & Agreements; 7) Financial Snapshot; 8) Key Policies; 9) Orientation Logistics; 10) First 90-Day Checklist; 11) Materials & Links; 12) Contacts & Support; 13) Sign-off.
- Include concrete specifics using these inputs: [MISSION SUMMARY (50 words)], [FOUNDING YEAR], [SERVICE AREA], [ANNUAL BUDGET], [FUNDING MIX %], [BOARD SIZE], [MEETING CADENCE], [GIVE/GET OR FUNDRAISING EXPECTATION], [COMMITTEES], [CURRENT STRATEGIC PRIORITIES], [KEY POLICIES], [STATE], [LEGAL STATUS e.g., 501(c)(3)].
- Provide a 2-hour and 4-hour sample orientation agenda with timed segments, including a site visit/virtual tour and a board mentor pairing.
- Add time estimates per section and note which staff/board lead each segment.
- Translate fiduciary duty into plain actions (e.g., “Review Form 990 annually,” “Disclose conflicts before votes,” “Read financials before meetings”).
- Include a one-page Day 1 Quickstart and a 90-day action checklist (e.g., meet ED/Chair, join a committee, make first gift, attend one program).
- Offer a simple board handbook contents list and a shared-folder structure (Bylaws, Strategic Plan, Budget, Calendar, Policies, Roster).
- Note update cadence and owner: [UPDATE CADENCE] owned by [POINT OF CONTACT].
- Specify authors/signers: message jointly from [BOARD CHAIR NAME] and [ED NAME].
- Length: 900–1,200 words; write for busy readers (scannable bullets, short paragraphs).

Quality matters: be specific, nonprofit-grounded, and actionable. Avoid jargon, clichés, and corporate metaphors. Include realistic examples (small budget, mixed funding). Emphasize equity, confidentiality, and legal compliance (COI, whistleblower, document retention, D&O insurance, state filings). Keep expectations clear and measurable; don’t blur staff vs. board roles.
