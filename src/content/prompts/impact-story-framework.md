## The Prompt

```
Impact Story Generator: Dignity-Centered Testimonial Framework

Purpose: Create an ethical, compelling impact story for [CHANNEL: newsletter/website/grant report/social media] that centers participant voice and demonstrates program outcomes.

BEFORE YOU START: Information Checklist

Required (5–6 items):
- Program name and 1-sentence description
- Beneficiary first name or pseudonym (confirm consent on file)
- 2–3 specific outcomes with numbers (e.g., “attended 12 sessions,” “increased income by 30%,” “secured housing within 60 days”)
- 1–2 direct quotes from participant (2–4 sentences each) OR write “NEED QUOTES”
- Target audience (donors/funders/community members/clients)
- Channel (newsletter/website/grant report/social media)

Optional but recommended:
- Before/after context (barriers and what changed)
- Program details (duration, partners, approach, supports provided)
- General location (city/region; avoid exact sites)
- Consent date and anonymization requirements (pseudonym, composite, minor safeguards)

INPUT FORMAT (Copy and complete below)

Program: [Name and 1-sentence description]  
Participant: [First name or pseudonym – consent on file: YES/NO/DATE]  
Outcomes (with numbers): [Bullet list; at least 2 concrete metrics]  
Quotes: [Paste 1–2 direct quotes, or write “NEED QUOTES”]  
Context: [2–4 sentences on before/after; avoid identifying details]  
Audience: [Donors/Funders/Community/Clients]  
Channel: [Newsletter/Website/Grant/Social]  
Tone: [FORMAL (funder-facing) / WARM (donor/community-facing) / CASUAL (social-friendly)]  
Location: [City/region only]  
Program details: [Duration, frequency, partners, supports; annual reach if relevant]  
Privacy notes: [Anonymization needed? Composite? Minor? Details to omit? Accessibility needs?]

STORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (300–450 words total)

Use these section headers and word ranges:
1) Headline (8–12 words, benefit-focused)
   - Example: “From Uncertainty to Stability: Job Training Opens Doors for Maya”
2) Hook (1–2 sentences; 25–40 words)
   - Orient the reader with a clear before/now contrast.
3) Before: The Challenge (60–80 words)
   - What context led them to the program? Focus on environment and goals, not graphic details. Avoid deficit labels.
4) The Intervention (80–100 words)
   - What did your organization do? Include duration, frequency, who was involved (staff/volunteers/partners), supports provided (e.g., childcare, transit).
   - Add one program-level metric if useful (e.g., “part of a cohort of 24,” “program served 320 residents last year”).
5) After: The Outcome (80–100 words)
   - What specifically changed? Include 2–3 concrete metrics (attendance, time frames, credentials earned, income/hours, retention, housing stability).
   - Emphasize the participant’s choices, skills, and actions.
6) Direct Quote(s) (1–2 quotes; 2–4 sentences each)
   - If quotes are missing, insert: [PLACEHOLDER – QUOTE NEEDED].
7) Call to Action (1–2 sentences)
   - Tailor to the audience and channel (donate, volunteer, refer, learn more, advocate). Include a link or clear next step if available.

Writing Guidelines
- Reading level: 8th–9th grade; short sentences; plain language.
- Tone: Match the selected Tone (FORMAL/WARM/CASUAL) and channel.
- Voice: Use active voice; make the participant the subject when possible.
- Dignity-centered language:
  - Do: “Sam chose to enroll,” “built skills,” “partnered with,” “achieved,” “advocated for”
  - Avoid: “saved,” “rescued,” “gave a voice,” “unfortunate,” “disadvantaged”
- Privacy and safety:
  - Use first name or pseudonym only; generalize location (“a local school”).
  - Omit identifying details (exact employer/school, diagnoses, case numbers).
  - For minors: note caregiver consent; avoid identifying descriptors and photos if not approved.
  - Composite stories: permitted when needed for privacy. Combine insights from 2–3 similar cases, avoid unique identifiers, and log composite use in Internal Documentation with leadership approval.
- Metrics: Favor specific, verifiable numbers.
  - Strong: “Completed 18 tutoring sessions,” “earned OSHA-10,” “95% attendance,” “retained housing for 9 months”
  - Weak: “improved a lot,” “doing better,” “many sessions”
- Accessibility:
  - Use plain language; describe visuals in a photo caption and alt text.
  - Avoid text-only images; ensure color contrast and link clarity.

Metadata to Include in Story
- Byline: “Story by [Your Name/Title]”
- Photo caption: “[Brief, non-identifying description]”
- Alt text: “[Descriptive alt text for accessibility]”

INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION (Do not publish; provide after the story)

Consent & Privacy Checklist
- Consent on file: [YES/NO/DATE]
- Reviewed by participant: [YES/NO/PENDING]
- Anonymization applied: [Pseudonym used; locations generalized; partners generalized; other]
- Composite story: [YES/NO – if YES: composite of X participants; approved by [Leader/Director]]
- Minor safeguards (if applicable): [Caregiver consent date; photo restrictions; school generalized]
- Approved channels: [Newsletter/Website/Social/Grant/All]
- Accessibility checks: [Reading level; alt text included; caption provided; links verified]

If Information Is Missing (use this single protocol)
- Insert clearly marked placeholders in the story (e.g., [PLACEHOLDER – QUOTE NEEDED], [PLACEHOLDER – METRIC]).
- Then list 3–5 precise follow-up questions to resolve gaps.

EXAMPLE SNIPPET (for reference; adapt style to your Tone/Channel)

Headline: Building Confidence, One Recipe at a Time
Hook: When James first visited our culinary training kitchen, he hadn’t worked in a professional setting. Four months later, he’s prepping 200 meals a day at a neighborhood café.
Before: After several moves, James wanted steady work but lacked recent references. “I knew I could work hard, but I didn’t know where to start,” he says. Online applications went unanswered.
The Intervention: Through our 16-week Culinary Pathways program, James trained four days a week in knife skills, food safety, and kitchen operations. He worked with a job coach, received bus passes, and completed a paid internship at a partner restaurant. He was part of a cohort of 22 participants last year.
After: James earned a food handler’s certificate and three references. Within two weeks, he accepted a full-time prep cook role. He maintained 100% attendance for 90 days and received a raise in month three.
Quote: “I’m not just earning a paycheck—I’m building a career. I feel proud when I plate meals that people enjoy.”
