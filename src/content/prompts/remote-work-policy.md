## The Prompt

```
Draft a nonprofit-specific Remote Work Policy for [ORGANIZATION NAME] that balances flexibility with program delivery, equity, and donor/client confidentiality.

The policy should:
- Be 900–1,100 words (≈2–3 pages) and usable by a small HR/operations team.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (policy/legal, board-facing), WARM (people-centered, professional), or CASUAL (plain language, still compliant).
- Follow sections in this order: Purpose & Scope; Definitions (Remote/Hybrid/In-Office); Eligibility by Role; Work Schedules & Core Hours; Communication & Meetings; Technology & Security; Workspace & Ergonomics; Performance & Accountability; Equity & Accessibility; Expenses & Equipment; Office Use/Travel; Implementation (Trial, Review, Exceptions); Compliance & Acknowledgment; Governance & Signatures.
- State eligibility: list [ELIGIBLE ROLES] and [INELIGIBLE ROLES] with mission/program rationale and any on-site requirements.
- Set availability norms: core hours [CORE HOURS] in [TIME ZONE]; response time [RESPONSE TIME]; meeting cadence [MEETING CADENCE]; camera expectations [CAMERA EXPECTATIONS].
- Specify communication tools [TOOLS LIST]; when to use each; documentation norms for decisions and client/donor records.
- Define technology/security: devices [EQUIPMENT PROVIDED/BRING YOUR OWN]; MFA/VPN; data handling (donors/clients); compliance [COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK]; IT support expectations [IT SUPPORT/SLA]; incident reporting.
- Include workspace/ergonomics: safety checklist; stipend or cap [STIPEND AMOUNT]/[REIMBURSEMENT CAP]; ADA accommodation process.
- Clarify performance: outputs-based KPIs [KPI LIST]; check-ins; timekeeping and overtime rules for [STATE/COUNTRY]; consequences applied consistently.
- Address equity/pay: consistent criteria; geographic pay policy [PAY POLICY]; fairness for part-time and volunteer coordination roles.
- Implementation: effective date [EFFECTIVE DATE]; trial length [TRIAL LENGTH]; annual review in [REVIEW MONTH]; exceptions approved by [APPROVER TITLE].
- Governance: Issued by [ISSUER TITLE]; Approved by [BOARD/COMMITTEE]; Revision date [DATE]; include employee acknowledgment language.

Produce concrete, non-jargon guidance with numbers, examples, and simple steps suitable for limited budgets and IT capacity. Include a brief mission-aligned rationale and board-facing metrics [METRICS] (e.g., service outputs, fundraising goals, turnaround times, cost savings). Avoid clichés, blanket promises, or language that conflicts with at-will and local laws; note “subject to legal review.” Ensure inclusive, consistent application across roles.
