## The Prompt

```
Write concise, donor- and community-facing About page copy for [ORGANIZATION NAME] using the inputs provided.

The About page copy should:
- Follow this structure, in order: 1) H1 headline (6–10 words); 2) Mission statement (1–2 sentences); 3) Origin story (why founded, [YEAR FOUNDED], problem you set out to solve – 1 short paragraph); 4) What we do now (programs/services, [SERVICE AREA], who you serve, [PEOPLE SERVED]/year – 1 paragraph); 5) Impact snapshot (1–3 metrics with timeframe and source); 6) Values/approach (3–5 bullets); 7) Credibility cues (partners/accreditations/awards – optional); 8) Link line to Programs, Team, Annual Report; 9) Closing call to action.
- Be 450–550 words with short sentences and scannable paragraphs.
- Use [TONE]: FORMAL (polished, funder-facing), WARM (welcoming, community-centered), or CASUAL (friendly, youth-forward). Default WARM if unspecified.
- Aim for Grade [READING LEVEL] (8–10 recommended); define acronyms on first use; avoid jargon.
- Include these specifics: [YEAR FOUNDED], [SERVICE AREA], [PEOPLE SERVED]/year, [PROGRAMS/CORE SERVICES], [IMPACT METRICS] (e.g., “In 2024, 87%…”), [VALUES] or [APPROACH], [PARTNERS/ACCREDITATIONS] (optional), [AWARDS] (optional).
- Write a benefit-focused H1 (center community impact, not the organization).
- Replace vague claims with concrete facts; use active voice; people-first, inclusive language.
- Add a “Learn more” line linking to: [PROGRAMS URL], [TEAM URL], [ANNUAL REPORT URL].
- Close with a single sentence CTA to [CALL TO ACTION] linking to [CTA URL] (e.g., Donate, Volunteer, Subscribe).
- Do not fabricate data; if an optional element is unknown, omit it rather than guessing.
- Avoid clichés (“make a difference,” “empower communities”) unless paired with a metric or example.
- No personal sign-off; organizational voice only.

Quality matters more than flourish. Prioritize clarity, specificity, and credibility. Center the community served before the organization; show change with time-bound metrics and plain-English outcomes. Keep copy skimmable for busy donors, partners, media, and volunteers. Avoid mission drift, buzzwords, and inflated claims; ensure dates, numbers, and service areas are accurate and current. Link to deeper content instead of over-explaining.
