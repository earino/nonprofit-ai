After 15+ years working in nonprofit development and consulting, I've seen the same pattern again and again: brilliant, mission-driven professionals stretched impossibly thin, drowning in administrative work that keeps them from their actual mission.

## The Problem

Executive Directors write grant proposals at midnight. Communications Managers create social content from scratch every single week. Development Directors personalize 200 thank-you letters while juggling major donor cultivation. Program Managers document outcomes in 12 different formats for 12 different funders.

Meanwhile, the for-profit world has embraced AI tools that save hours of work. But when nonprofit professionals try to use ChatGPT or Claude, they hit a wall: generic prompts designed for corporate marketing don't understand donor psychology, grant requirements, or the constraints of a 2-person development shop.

## The Solution

Nonprofit.ai provides 80 AI prompts built specifically for nonprofit work. Each prompt:

- **Incorporates sector knowledge**: Fundraising best practices, grant requirements, volunteer management, board governance
- **Respects resource constraints**: Realistic for small teams, limited budgets, competing priorities
- **Produces usable outputs**: Minimal editing needed, appropriate tone, proper structure

Every prompt has been tested across multiple AI models (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini) with realistic nonprofit scenarios to ensure quality.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Browse by category**: Find prompts for your role (Development Director, Communications Manager, etc.) or task (thank-you letters, grant writing, social media)
2. **Copy the prompt**: One click copies to clipboard
3. **Customize the [BRACKETS]**: Replace placeholder fields with your specific information
4. **Paste into your AI tool**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini - use whatever you prefer
5. **Review and personalize**: Always review AI output for accuracy and brand voice

## What Makes These Prompts Different

These aren't generic "write a newsletter" prompts. They include:

- Specific word counts and structural guidance
- Nonprofit-appropriate language and tone options
- Sector best practices (60-30-10 content mix, thank-you timing, grant evaluation criteria)
- Common pain points addressed (time constraints, limited staff, donor fatigue)
- Quality criteria (what to avoid, what makes good output)

For example, the Year-End Campaign Email Series prompt doesn't just say "write fundraising emails." It provides:
- 3-email sequence with specific timing (Dec 1-10, Dec 15-23, Dec 28-31)
- Segmentation variants for donors who already gave, opened-but-didn't-give, lapsed donors, unopened
- Subject line options, preheaders, CTAs, P.S. recommendations
- Compliance requirements (tax-deductible language, EIN, unsubscribe)
- Suppression rules to avoid duplicate asks

## Who This Is For

- **Small to mid-size nonprofits** (annual budget < $5M) where staff wear many hats
- **Professionals new to AI** who need clear, specific prompts
- **Under-resourced teams** looking to work smarter, not longer
- **Mission-driven leaders** who want to spend less time on admin and more time on impact

## The Philosophy

**Free forever.** No paywalls, no freemium tiers, no "upgrade to premium." This resource exists because under-resourced nonprofits shouldn't have to pay for tools that help them work more efficiently.

**Open source.** All prompts are available on GitHub. Submit improvements via pull request. The nonprofit sector advances when we share knowledge.

**Quality over quantity.** Every prompt has been AI-generated, critiqued by Claude, refined by GPT-5, and tested across scenarios. Average quality score: 7.91/10. We'd rather have 80 excellent prompts than 300 mediocre ones.

## What's Next

We're continuously improving prompts based on user feedback and testing. Planned additions:

- Multi-language support (Spanish, French to start)
- Prompt customizer tool (fill form → get personalized prompt)
- Community contributions (submit your tested prompts)
- Integration guides for popular nonprofit CRMs
