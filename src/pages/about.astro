        A free, open-source repository of AI prompts designed specifically for nonprofit professionals.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Nonprofit staff are overwhelmed. With 95% of nonprofit leaders experiencing burnout and many organizations operating with skeleton crews, there's never been a greater need for efficiency tools that actually work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonprofit.ai exists to help nonprofit professionals save time and increase impact by providing tested, ready-to-use AI prompts for the tasks that consume hours of their day: donor communications, grant writing, social media content, program reports, and more.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        While 58% of nonprofits are now using AI tools, 40% lack staff with AI training. Most AI prompt resources are generic business tools that don't understand nonprofit sector constraints, culture, or language.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created Nonprofit.ai to fill that gap with prompts that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are designed for nonprofit contexts and audiences</li>
        <li>Use sector-appropriate language and tone</li>
        <li>Respect resource constraints (time, budget, staff capacity)</li>
        <li>Incorporate nonprofit best practices</li>
        <li>Are tested with real AI models and validated for quality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Ensure Quality</h2>
      <p>
        Every prompt on this site has been validated through our testing framework:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real scenarios:</strong> We test each prompt with 3 realistic nonprofit contexts (small community org, mid-size professional org, large established org)</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-model testing:</strong> Each scenario is tested across ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude (Sonnet 4.5), and Gemini 2.5 Flash</li>
        <li><strong>AI evaluation:</strong> Outputs are scored for tone, completeness, usefulness, accuracy, and authenticity</li>
        <li><strong>Quality threshold:</strong> We aim for 8.0+ average scores across all outputs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This means you see real, validated examples - not theoretical outputs or made-up scenarios.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Created This</h2>
      <p>
        Nonprofit.ai was created by <strong>Leigh S. Ariño de la Rubia, Ed.D.</strong>, a nonprofit consultant with over 15 years of experience in fundraising, grant writing, program evaluation, and strategic planning.
