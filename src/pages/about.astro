        A free, open-source repository of AI prompts designed specifically for nonprofit professionals.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        Nonprofit staff are overwhelmed. According to the <a href="https://cep.org/news/press-releases/nonprofit-leaders-cite-burnout-as-a-top-concern-in-a-new-study-on-the-state-of-u-s-nonprofits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Effective Philanthropy's 2024 State of Nonprofits report</a>, 95% of nonprofit leaders express concern about burnout, with many organizations operating with skeleton crews. Meanwhile, according to <a href="https://www.nonprofitpro.com/article/2025-ai-benchmark-report-how-artificial-intelligence-is-changing-the-nonprofit-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 AI research</a>, 58% of nonprofits have integrated AI into their daily operations—yet the <a href="https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2025/05/5-steps-nonprofits-can-take-adopt-ai-responsibly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 Nonprofit Standards Benchmarking Survey</a> found that only 24% have a formal AI strategy. Most AI prompt resources are generic business tools that don't understand nonprofit sector constraints, culture, or language.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created Nonprofit.ai to fill that gap with prompts that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are designed for nonprofit contexts and audiences</li>
        <li>Use sector-appropriate language and tone</li>
        <li>Respect resource constraints (time, budget, staff capacity)</li>
        <li>Incorporate nonprofit best practices</li>
        <li>Are tested with real AI models and validated for quality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Ensure Quality</h2>
      <p>
        Every prompt on this site has been validated through our testing framework:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real scenarios:</strong> We test each prompt with 3 realistic nonprofit contexts (small community org, mid-size professional org, large established org)</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-model testing:</strong> Each scenario is tested across ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude (Sonnet 4.5), and Gemini 2.5 Flash</li>
        <li><strong>AI evaluation:</strong> Outputs are scored for tone, completeness, usefulness, accuracy, and authenticity</li>
        <li><strong>Quality threshold:</strong> We aim for 8.0+ average scores across all outputs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This means you see real, validated examples - not theoretical outputs or made-up scenarios.
      </p>
