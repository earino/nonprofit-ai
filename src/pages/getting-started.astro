      <h2>What is AI and How Can It Help Nonprofits?</h2>
      <p>
        AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are language models that can help you write content faster. Think of them as smart writing assistants that can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Draft donor thank-you letters</li>
        <li>Write social media posts</li>
        <li>Create grant proposal sections</li>
        <li>Generate email newsletters</li>
        <li>Develop program descriptions</li>
        <li>And much more</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Use These Prompts</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Find a Prompt</h3>
      <p>Browse prompts by category or search for what you need. Each prompt is tagged by role, difficulty, and use case.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Copy the Prompt</h3>
      <p>Click the "Copy" button to copy the prompt to your clipboard.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Customize It</h3>
      <p>Replace the [BRACKETED] fields with your specific information. For example, replace [ORGANIZATION NAME] with your nonprofit's actual name.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Use with AI</h3>
      <p>Paste the customized prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. The AI will generate content based on your prompt.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Review and Edit</h3>
      <p>ALWAYS review AI output before using it. Add your personal touch, verify facts, and ensure it matches your organization's voice.</p>

      <h2>Which AI Tool Should I Use?</h2>
      <p>
        Our prompts work with all major AI tools:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> (OpenAI): Most popular, good all-around performance. Free and paid tiers available.</li>
        <li><strong>Claude</strong> (Anthropic): Excellent at following instructions precisely, great for longer content.</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini</strong> (Google): Fast and cost-effective, good for quick tasks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On each prompt page, you can see example outputs from all three models to help you choose.
      </p>

      <h2>Prompt Customization Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> The more detail you provide, the better the output</li>
        <li><strong>Set the tone:</strong> Specify if you want formal, warm, casual, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide context:</strong> Add relevant background about your organization or situation</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate:</strong> If the first output isn't perfect, ask the AI to revise it</li>
        <li><strong>Save good prompts:</strong> When you find prompts that work well, bookmark them or save customized versions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <p>Absolutely! Customize them for your organization's needs. That's the whole point.</p>

      <h3>What if the output isn't good?</h3>
      <p>Try a different AI model (see our examples), add more context to your prompt, or iterate by asking the AI to revise specific parts.</p>
