Your truly transformational gift of $50,000 to Southside Fresh Food Collective has left me speechless, and quite frankly, incredibly inspired.\n\nFor years now, you've been more than just a supporter; you've been a true partner in our mission. From being among our earliest donors in 2019, to rolling up your sleeves as a fantastic volunteer \u2013 I fondly remember seeing you and your neighbors at our urban farm almost every Saturday. And who could forget the incredible backyard harvest fundraiser you hosted in 2022? That event brought our community together in such a beautiful way. Your generous spirit even extended to lending your exceptional pro bono design skills to brand our Mobile Market, giving it the vibrant, welcoming look it has today.\n\nThis $50,000 gift, especially at this critical juncture, is nothing short of a game-changer. It will directly fuel the expansion of our Community Mobile Market and, crucially, significantly strengthen our Youth Kitchen Apprenticeship program. Imagine a new generation of Southside youth, not just learning culinary skills, but also understanding the importance of fresh, local food from seed to plate. Your gift means we can purchase a larger, more efficient Mobile Market vehicle, reaching even more food-insecure families. It means we can equip our Youth Kitchen with state-of-the-art tools, giving apprentices like Maria, who shared with me just last week how much she loves cooking with fresh produce, the best possible start. It means we can offer more stipends, alleviating financial barriers for promising young chefs eager to learn.\n\nThis isn't just about numbers; it's about lives changed. It\u2019s about more single mothers having access to nutritious meals for their children, simply because our market can now reach their neighborhood. It's about empowering young people with skills that will open doors to bright futures, instilled with a passion for healthy eating that will ripple through our community for years to come.\n\nYour unwavering belief in our work, demonstrated so powerfully by this exceptional gift, truly makes you a critical architect of a healthier, more vibrant Southside. I would love to connect further in the coming weeks and personally share how your generosity is taking shape. Perhaps a visit to the Mobile Market in action, or even a chance to meet some of the youth apprentices in our kitchen? I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll love seeing the direct impact of your kindness.\n\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being such an extraordinary friend and champion of Southside Fresh Food Collective.\n\nWith immense gratitude,\n\nMariela Ortiz\nExecutive Director\nSouthside Fresh Food Collective",

I don't use that word lightly, but there's simply no other way to describe what you've made possible.\n\nBecause of you, our Community Mobile Market will reach twelve neighborhoods this summer\u2014twelve communities where the nearest grocery store is a forty-minute bus ride away. But here's what that really means: Ms. Rodriguez, who you met at your backyard harvest party, will have fresh vegetables within walking distance of her apartment for the first time in eight years. The Nguyen family won't have to choose between produce and the bus fare to get it.\n\nAnd the Youth Kitchen Apprenticeship? Six young people\u2014including two graduates from our cooking workshops\u2014will earn their first paychecks this June preparing healthy grab-and-go meals that'll stock the Mobile Market. They'll learn knife skills, food safety, and what it means to nourish their own community. One told me last week: \"I want my little sister to see someone who looks like her working in a real kitchen.\"\n\nYou've been part of our story since 2019, but this feels like a new chapter we're writing together. From that first gift to hosting fundraisers in your own backyard, to those late-night design sessions to get the Market branding just right\u2014you've given us so much more than money. You've given us your time, your creativity, and your belief that our neighbors deserve better.\n\nI'd love to invite you to the Mobile Market launch on June 15th. Come see the truck roll into Ms. Rodriguez's neighborhood. Better yet, let's find time before then to sit down\u2014just us\u2014and dream about where we go next. You're not a donor to me. You're a partner, a neighbor, and proof that transformation starts with one person who decides to act.\n\nWith profound gratitude,\n\n**Mariela Ortiz**  \nExecutive Director",

You\u2019ve been with Southside Fresh Food Collective from the start: your first gift in 2019, rolling up your sleeves as volunteers, that joyful backyard harvest fundraiser in 2022, and your beautiful pro bono design work that still gives our Mobile Market its welcoming face. This latest investment is transformational.\n\nHere\u2019s what your gift will unlock right away for the Community Mobile Market & Youth Kitchen Apprenticeship:\n- Add a second weekly Mobile Market route, reaching three new apartment complexes and two senior buildings.\n- Equip the truck with a commercial-grade cooler, weatherproof shelving, and a handwashing station\u2014so produce stays crisp and safe even on hot days.\n- Cover fuel, maintenance, and a SNAP Match fund that doubles fruit-and-veg purchases for families who use EBT.\n- Provide paid stipends for 20 youth apprentices this spring, along with their food-safety certifications and chef-mentor hours in our kitchen classroom.\n\nLet me tell you what that looks like in a person\u2019s life. Last month, Jamila, 17, wrapped up a shift in the Youth Kitchen Apprenticeship grinning ear to ear. She\u2019d mastered knife skills and planned the day\u2019s menu\u2014roasted squash tacos with citrus slaw\u2014then walked over to the Mobile Market to help a grandmother pick out greens for a Sunday stew. \u201cI told her how to keep the cilantro fresh,\u201d she said, \u201clike Chef taught me.\u201d Jamila took home the same recipe and made dinner for her family. That loop\u2014learning, earning, and serving\u2014will happen hundreds more times because of you.\n\nI\u2019d love to thank you in person and share a brief update. Could we schedule a visit to the kitchen on a Tuesday afternoon to meet the apprentices, then ride along for a Mobile Market stop? I\u2019ll call next week to find a time that works for you, and we\u2019ll send a photo update after the first new route launches.\n\nYou are not just donors; you are co-builders of this work. Every smile at the market and every youth paycheck carries your fingerprints\u2014quite literally in the brand you created and the community you continue to nurture.\n\nWith deep gratitude,\n\nMariela Ortiz\nExecutive Director\nSouthside Fresh Food Collective",

This level of philanthropic vision and generosity is nothing short of inspiring, and it marks a pivotal moment in our shared mission to protect and preserve the irreplaceable ecosystems of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nYour commitment to conservation has long been a bedrock for our work. Since 2017, the Tannen Family Foundation has championed our trail restoration efforts, notably funding the critical Elk Creek reroute and underwriting two invaluable AmeriCorps crews. We also remember with immense gratitude Dana Tannen's leadership in last year's matching challenge, which galvanized unparalleled community support. This history of unwavering dedication underscores our deep appreciation for your continued partnership.\n\nThis extraordinary $250,000 gift will have an immediate and tangible impact on the Colorado Headwaters Restoration Initiative. It will allow us to immediately launch phase one of the crucial Willow Creek stabilization project, preventing an estimated 10,000 cubic yards of sediment from polluting prime trout spawning grounds, directly improving fish populations in the upper Colorado River within the next two years. Beyond this, your generosity will fully fund the native species reintroduction program along the damaged riparian zones of the Blue River, bringing back essential pollinators and fostering biodiversity in an area that has struggled to recover. Imagine the clear, flowing waters, vibrant with life, that your investment will directly create \u2013 a living legacy for generations to come.\n\nYour partnership extends far beyond a financial contribution; you are integral to the very fabric of our success. You empower us to turn ambitious plans into concrete realities, fostering a healthier, more resilient Rocky Mountain ecosystem. We are not just grateful for your support, but immensely proud to have you standing with us.\n\nI would be honored to provide you with a personal update on the Willow Creek project's progress in the coming months, perhaps over a call or even a site visit in the spring, once work is underway. We are eager to share the tangible results of your generosity with you directly.\n\nWith deepest respect and appreciation,\n\n\nDr. Jerome Pike\nBoard Chair\nRocky Mountain Conservation Alliance",

The stream, choked by decades of mining runoff and destabilized banks, barely sustained life. Thanks to your leadership, this watershed will tell a different story. Your gift will enable us to remove 12,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment, reestablish native vegetation across 47 acres of riparian corridor, and restore critical spawning habitat for the cutthroat trout that haven't reproduced successfully here since 1982.\n\nBut here's what moves me most: the hydrologist on our team grew up fishing these streams with her grandfather. She'll lead this project. The AmeriCorps crews you've supported since 2017\u2014young people who discovered their calling on the Elk Creek reroute\u2014will return as restoration specialists. This is the ripple effect of sustained partnership.\n\nYour family's vision has created something rare: institutional capacity that endures. The expertise built through your previous support made this ambitious headwaters initiative possible. Dana, your leadership in last year's matching challenge didn't just raise funds\u2014it challenged our entire board to think bigger about what we could accomplish together.\n\nI'd welcome the opportunity to walk the headwaters site with you this summer, ideally in late July when we'll begin the sediment removal. You should see firsthand what your partnership makes possible. I'll also send quarterly updates written by our field team, sharing both challenges and victories as they unfold.\n\nThe Tannen family hasn't just funded our work\u2014you've shaped our capacity to dream ambitiously and deliver meaningfully.

Your leadership arrives at exactly the right moment, allowing us to move from site-by-site fixes to the kind of watershed-scale restoration our headwaters deserve.\n\nYour family\u2019s steady commitment since 2017 has already changed the way people experience these mountains\u2014the Elk Creek reroute you funded turned a braided, eroding trail into a resilient corridor, and the AmeriCorps crews you underwrote set a new bar for what a season of stewardship can accomplish. I still think of a late-September afternoon there: our crew leader pointed to a bend once scoured to bare gravel. In the quiet, you could hear water threading through willow roots and see fresh elk tracks in the damp soil. A place that had been unraveling was stitching itself back together.\n\nThis new gift accelerates that healing across the headwaters. Specifically, it will enable us to:\n- Reconnect more than three miles of side channels and floodplain, cooling water and restoring habitat for native trout.\n- Replace two failing culverts to reopen upstream passage and reduce sediment pulses during high flows.\n- Install beaver-dam analogs and stabilize banks with willow and cottonwood plantings, re-wetting 30+ acres of meadow.\n- Field two AmeriCorps crews and a seasonal hydrology technician to implement and monitor projects throughout the 2025 field season.\n- Launch community science monitoring so local partners and students can help track temperature, flow, and vegetation recovery.\n\nJust as important, your gift positions us to leverage additional public and private funds, multiplying its impact well beyond a single season. And Dana, your leadership in last year\u2019s matching challenge showed what\u2019s possible when the community follows your example.\n\nI would value the chance to walk a project reach with you in late June and introduce you to our restoration team and local partners. I will send a brief progress update in May with timelines and a proposed site-visit date; we can also schedule a stewardship briefing at your convenience.\n\nThank you for being a true partner in this work\u2014not simply funding projects, but shaping the future of Colorado\u2019s headwaters.\n\nWith deep gratitude,\n\nDr. Jerome Pike\nBoard Chair\nRocky Mountain Conservation Alliance",

Words feel insufficient to convey the depth of our appreciation for this extraordinary commitment.\n\nThis gift is not merely a donation; it is a monumental leap forward for countless children and families in rural communities who currently lack access to vital literacy resources. Your long-standing partnership, beginning with the challenge grant in 2016, and deepened by the establishment of the Patel Scholars Fund in 2019, has consistently propelled our mission. As a cherished member of our National Advisory Council since 2020, your insights and dedication have always been invaluable, and this latest act of generosity truly illustrates your unwavering belief in the power of literacy.\n\nThe $2,000,000 you have so generously contributed will be the cornerstone of our efforts to establish fifty new digital library hubs in underserved rural areas over the next two years. Imagine a child, perhaps in a remote Appalachian town, who has never held a book that truly captivated them. Thanks to you, that child will now be able to explore an entire universe of stories, knowledge, and educational tools. Picture a single mother in a remote farming community, previously unable to access evening classes due to distance and cost, now able to skill-up and secure better employment through our online learning modules. Your gift will bridge these divides, fostering both academic growth and economic opportunity. This isn't just about providing technology; it's about igniting imaginations, building futures, and empowering entire communities.\n\nMeera, you and the Patel Family are not just donors; you are integral partners, true champions of literacy, and co-authors of every success story that will unfold from this initiative. Your vision and trust in our work inspire us daily.\n\nI would be honored to provide you with a personal update on the immediate launch of the Rural Access Accelerator at your earliest convenience, perhaps over a cup of coffee. We are also eager to arrange a site visit to one of our inaugural digital library hubs once they are operational, so you can witness the palpable impact of your generosity firsthand.\n\nWith deepest gratitude and admiration,\n\nAisha Rahman\nPresident & CEO",

It's transformational, yes\u2014but what moves me most is what it represents: eight years of believing in us, challenging us, and standing beside us as true partners.\n\nI keep thinking about Maria, a single mother in rural Kentucky. Her nearest library closed three years ago, and the bookmobile stopped coming when funding dried up. Last week, she told our team that her daughter checks out twenty books a month from our new digital platform\u2014on a refurbished tablet we provide\u2014and has gone from struggling reader to the kid who performs poetry at school assemblies. Maria cried telling us this. I cried hearing it.\n\nYour extraordinary commitment to the Digital Libraries for All Campaign\u2014Rural Access Accelerator means 300 more communities like Maria's will have what every child deserves: unlimited access to stories, learning, and possibility. Your gift will deploy digital libraries to 300,000 rural families, train 1,500 local literacy champions, and keep these programs running for five years. But really, you're changing family trees. You're proving that zip code doesn't determine destiny.\n\nFrom that first $100,000 challenge grant in 2016 that electrified our organization, to the Patel Scholars Fund that's already graduated its first cohort, to Meera's invaluable guidance on our Advisory Council\u2014you've shaped who we've become. This gift doesn't just accelerate our mission; it embodies the fearless partnership we've built together.\n\nI'd love to take you to meet Maria and her daughter this spring\u2014would a Kentucky site visit in April work? We're also planning our first Rural Access leadership summit in June, and your presence would mean everything to the communities you're empowering.\n\nThank you for seeing us not as a charity to support, but as co-creators of a more literate, equitable America. That's exactly who you've helped us become.\n\nWith profound gratitude and deep partnership,\n\nAisha Rahman  \nPresident & CEO",
