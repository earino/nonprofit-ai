          "Both orientation agendas (2-hour and 4-hour) are genuinely usable with specific facilitators, realistic timing, and smart sequencing (e.g., virtual tour of platform, live webinar attendance)",
          "90-day checklist is specific, sequenced logically, and includes both governance tasks and relationship-building (mentor meetings, 1:1s, program attendance)",
          "Exceptional attention to 501(c)(6)-specific compliance issues (antitrust, meeting conduct, no quid pro quo) that many templates miss\u2014shows real sector knowledge",

          "The antitrust compliance mention is excellent and necessary for 501(c)(6), but could benefit from one more concrete example (e.g., 'Never discuss member pricing or salaries in board meetings') to ensure non-lawyer directors understand the stakes"

However, it contains a critical error (swapped names for Chair/ED throughout) that would confuse users, and misses some required elements like specifying staff vs. board leads for each timed segment consistently.",
        "strengths": [
          "Excellent casual tone that feels peer-to-peer and approachable without being unprofessional\u2014'no binders, no jargon, clear next steps' sets the right welcoming frame",
          "Strong practical tools: Day 1 Quickstart is genuinely scannable, 90-day checklist has concrete measurable actions, and the fiduciary duties appendix translates legal concepts into real board behaviors",
          "Realistic nonprofit grounding: acknowledges 'small team capacity,' includes tenant privacy and confidentiality throughout, addresses government contract compliance and cybersecurity appropriately for a $22M housing org",
          "Well-designed orientation agendas with realistic time blocks, hybrid options, and inclusion of tenant voice (tenant leader remarks during tour)",
          "Clear role boundaries between board and staff, especially in sections 5 and 7",

        "weaknesses": [
          "Critical accuracy error: Board Chair and ED names are reversed throughout\u2014the scenario lists Aisha Bennett as Chair and Rafael Santiago as ED, but the output swaps them in the welcome section and sign-off, creating confusion",
          "Incomplete time/lead attribution: While some sections note leads, many don't specify whether staff or board member is leading (e.g., sections 2, 3 need 'Chief Programs Officer' or similar staff title, not just 'Programs & Services Director')",
          "Missing explicit mention of D&O insurance beyond the policy list\u2014given the complexity and risk profile of this org, a sentence about coverage and why it matters would strengthen section 4 or 8",
          "The 'small team's capacity' framing in the welcome is inconsistent with a 23-board-member, $22M organization with a dedicated Board Governance Manager\u2014this language feels copy-pasted from a smaller org scenario",
          "Folder structure in section 11 could specify access permissions more clearly (e.g., which folders are board-editable vs. staff-only)",
          "Word count appears slightly under the 900\u20131,200 target (estimated ~850-900 words), missing opportunity for richer detail in strategic priorities or committee descriptions"
