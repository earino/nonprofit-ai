The warm tone is appropriate for sustaining donors, the structure is scannable and mobile-friendly, and practical details are comprehensive. Minor weaknesses include slightly generic phrasing in places and one small structural deviation.",

          "Excellent adherence to structure: What/When/Where in first 3 lines, CTA above fold, word count at ~265 words fits 200-280 target perfectly",

        "weaknesses": [
          "Opening 'why now' could be slightly more compelling\u2014'your steady support powers rapid action' is somewhat generic; could tie more directly to urgency of 2025 storm season",
          "Minor formatting inconsistency: 'What to expect' uses a dash bullet while 'Why it matters' uses standard bullets",
          "The DC office watch room detail, while thoughtful, adds slight complexity that may distract from the virtual-first message",
          "Phrase 'aimed where needs will be highest' in opening is slightly awkward; 'directed' or 'focused' would be cleaner"
