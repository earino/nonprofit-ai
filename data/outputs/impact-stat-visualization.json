  "prompt_text": "Impact Statistic Visualization Caption Generator\n\nPurpose: Create platform-ready social captions (with accessibility and optional designer guidance) for nonprofit impact statistics that earn engagement, saves, and shares.\n\nBest for: Program milestones, annual report highlights, campaign updates, funder accountability posts.\n\nSTEP 1: Provide Your Information (copy/paste and fill in)\nRequired\n1) Organization: [ORG NAME]\n2) Primary stat (number + what it measures): [e.g., \u201c1,247 students served\u201d or \u201c89% graduation rate\u201d]\n3) Platform: [Instagram / Facebook / LinkedIn / X]\n4) Target audience: [Donors / Funders / Volunteers / Community]\n5) Timeframe: [e.g., \u201cin 2024,\u201d \u201cJan\u2013Jun 2025,\u201d \u201csince 2019,\u201d \u201cas of Oct 2025\u201d]\n6) Geography/community: [e.g., \u201cin rural Montana,\u201d \u201cacross 12 Chicago neighborhoods\u201d]\n7) Source + year/URL: [e.g., \u201cInternal program data, 2024\u201d or \u201c2024 Annual Report, URL\u201d]\n\nRequired if using a percentage\n8) Base/denominator: [e.g., \u201c89% of 340 participants\u201d]\n\nOptional but recommended\n9) Relatable comparison: [e.g., \u201cequal to the population of Boise,\u201d \u201cenough to fill Soldier Field\u201d]\n10) Call to action (CTA): [e.g., \u201cDonate monthly,\u201d \u201cVolunteer this weekend,\u201d \u201cSave and share\u201d]\n11) Tone preference: [FORMAL / WARM / CASUAL] (default WARM)\n12) Staff quote/sign-off: [e.g., \u201c\u2014Maria Chen, Program Director\u201d] (use only if adding a quote)\n13) Designer notes needed?: [Yes/No] (default No)\n\nIf any required fields are missing, I will ask up to 3 concise clarification questions before generating. If a percentage lacks a base or date, I will convert to an absolute number if possible or ask for details.\n\nSTEP 2: Generate the Caption Package\n\nProduce Two Caption Options (A & B)\n- Length: 60\u201380 words each (see platform overrides below)\n- Use the SAME primary stat in both options; vary the lead, framing, and CTA.\n- A vs. B purpose: Two testable angles of the same fact.\n  \u2022 Option A: Lead with program/solution impact.\n  \u2022 Option B: Lead with community/individual perspective.\n\nRequired structure (per caption)\n1) Opening (insight, not a number): One human takeaway or why it matters.\n   - Weak: \u201cWe served 1,247 students this year.\u201d\n   - Strong: \u201cWhen students get steady tutoring, confidence and grades rise.\u201d\n2) Stat sentence with full context: Number + what + who + when + where (and base if %).\n   - Example: \u201cIn 2024, 1,247 students across 12 Chicago neighborhoods received free one-on-one tutoring through [ORG].\u201d\n3) Why it matters (plain language; no jargon/acronyms).\n4) Relatable comparison (if provided or credibly inferrable).\n5) Soft, platform-aligned CTA.\n6) Source citation at the end: (Source: [SOURCE], [YEAR/URL]).\n7) Hashtags: 2\u20134 relevant, TitleCase, at the very end.\n\nTone guidance\n- FORMAL (funders/LinkedIn): Precise, credible, data-forward. No emojis.\n- WARM (donors/community): Empathetic, hopeful, community-centered. Emoji ok (max 1).\n- CASUAL (volunteers/Instagram): Friendly, plain language. Emoji ok (max 2).\n\nPlatform length and formatting overrides\n- Instagram: Keep 60\u201380 words; front-load the hook in first 100\u2013125 characters; 1\u20132 line breaks ok.\n- Facebook: 60\u2013100 words; front-load key info in first 140 characters; links in comments if needed.\n- LinkedIn: 80\u2013140 words; no emojis in FORMAL; use line breaks for scannability.\n- X: Hard cap 280 characters; compress each option to \u2264240 characters, leaving room for 1\u20132 short hashtags. Prioritize: insight + stat context + CTA + source abbrev.\n\nContent rules for the statistic\n- Always include timeframe and geography/community.\n- If using a percentage, include base/denominator and timeframe (e.g., \u201c89% of 340 participants in 2024\u201d).\n- Use round numbers unless precision is critical to credibility.\n- People-first language; avoid deficit framing and guilt appeals.\n- If comparison isn\u2019t credible or may feel minimizing, omit it rather than forcing one.\n\nRelatable comparison ideas (use one if supplied or appropriate)\n- Population equivalence (e.g., \u201cequal to the population of [Town]\u201d)\n- Venue capacity (e.g., \u201cenough to fill [Landmark]\u201d)\n- Everyday scale (e.g., \u201cabout one full school bus per week\u201d)\n\nCTAs (select or adapt to platform)\n- Instagram: \u201cSave and share,\u201d \u201cLink in bio to donate monthly,\u201d \u201cVolunteer signup in bio.\u201d\n- Facebook: \u201cShare this post,\u201d \u201cDonate at the link in comments,\u201d \u201cRSVP to volunteer.\u201d\n- LinkedIn: \u201cFollow for data updates,\u201d \u201cConnect to explore funding partnerships,\u201d \u201cRead the full report.\u201d\n- X: \u201cRetweet to spread the word,\u201d \u201cSee link in thread for details.\u201d\n\nAlt Text (accessibility)\n- Write 1\u20132 sentences, 120\u2013160 characters total.\n- Describe the visual style and state the exact statistic text as shown.\n- No emojis, hashtags, or CTAs.\n- Example: \u201cBold white text on navy background reads: 1,247 Chicago students received free tutoring in 2024. Small source line at bottom right.\u201d\n\nDesigner Notes (include only if Step 1 #13 = Yes)\n- Format: 1080\u00d71080 (Instagram), 1200\u00d7628 (Facebook/X), 1200\u00d71200 (LinkedIn)\n- Visual: Single stat on simple solid background; no chart junk.\n- Typography: Large, bold sans-serif; minimum 16\u201318pt on mobile; test color contrast \u22654.5:1.\n- Hierarchy: Stat is hero; context smaller but readable; source bottom-right in 10\u201312pt.\n- Branding: Use org brand colors; small logo in a corner.\n\nDecision rules and conflict resolution\n- Prioritize order: Platform constraints > Audience needs > Tone preference.\n- If platform = LinkedIn but audience = Volunteers, keep FORMAL data clarity with a community-forward opening; avoid emojis.\n- If percentage lacks a base or timeframe, convert to an absolute count or ask for details; do not post a standalone percent.\n- If timeframe is ongoing, use \u201cas of [Month Year].\u201d\n- If geography unspecified, ask for it; if unavailable, use the smallest accurate scope from the source.\n- If comparison is absent or weak, omit it rather than stretching.\n- If tone not specified, default to WARM.\n\nQuality checklist (self-check before finalizing)\n- Concrete and dignifying; people-first language.\n- No deficit framing, guilt appeals, or clich\u00e9s (e.g., \u201ctransform lives,\u201d \u201cchange the world\u201d).\n- Verifiable: stat includes timeframe, geography, and base if %; cites a credible source.\n- Mobile-first: short sentences, scannable, clear hierarchy.\n- Platform-appropriate: tone and CTA match the channel.\n- Numbers are rounded unless precision is needed.\n\nMini examples: weak vs strong openings\n- Weak: \u201cWe served 2,300 meals.\u201d\n- Strong: \u201cA dependable hot meal turns a tough day into a doable one.\u201d\n\n- Weak: \u201cOur program reached 412 teens.\u201d\n- Strong: \u201cWhen teens find a safe place to belong, they keep showing up\u2014and keep growing.\u201d\n\nExample output (for reference)\nCaption A (WARM, Instagram, donors):\nA safe place after school changes the rhythm of a family\u2019s week. In 2024, 1,247 students across 12 Chicago neighborhoods received free one-on-one tutoring through [ORG]. With steady support, kids keep up in class and build confidence that carries home.
