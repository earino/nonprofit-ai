This Wednesday morning slot aligns with optimal engagement times for nonprofit awareness campaigns.\n\n---\n\n**X/Twitter Thread: Keep Coal Creek Warm**\n\n**A/B Test Options:**\n\n**Hook Option A:**\n(1/6) Did you know 1 in 3 families in Coal Creek heats their home with propane? With winter approaching, many face soaring costs. We're working to #KeepCoalCreekWarm.\n\n**Hook Option B (chosen for thread):**\n(1/6) Imagine your home without heat as winter bites. For 1 in 3 families in Coal Creek, that's a growing worry. Propane costs are up 27% & winter is coming. #KeepCoalCreekWarm\n\n---\n\n(2/6) That's an average of $480 to fill one tank \u2013 a huge jump from last year. Many families here in Eastern Kentucky simply can't afford it, putting children and elders at risk.\n\n(3/6) Tasha, a home health aide and mom of two, is feeling the pinch. She relies on propane to warm her home after long shifts caring for others, but refills are getting out of reach.\n\n(4/6) State heating aid (LIHEAP) is delayed 4\u20136 weeks, and the county\u2019s shutoff ban ends Nov 15. This puts renters like Tasha in a tough spot, even if their rent is paid on time.\n\n(5/6) We are Coal Creek Neighbors, and we help families meet basic needs. Right now, we\u2019re raising funds to provide 200 emergency propane vouchers before the first real freeze.\n\n**CTA Options:**\n\n**CTA Option A:**\n(6/6) Your gift of $25\u2013$100 can cover a portion of a tank refill. Help us reach our goal to secure warmth for 200 families. Donate & share: https://coalcreekneighbors.org/heat?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=propane2025&utm_content=awareness\n\n**CTA Option B (chosen for thread):**\n(6/6) We need your help to fund 200 emergency propane vouchers. A $25\u2013$100 donation covers crucial hours of warmth. Please donate and share this message with neighbors. https://coalcreekneighbors.org/heat?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=propane2025&utm_content=awareness\n\n---\n\n**Visual Ideas:**\n\n1.  **Image:** Photograph of a child's art drawing of a cozy house with smoke coming from the chimney, perhaps labeled \"Home.\"\n    *   **ALT Text (135 characters):** A child's colored pencil drawing of a warm, inviting home with smoke from the chimney.

It symbolizes community warmth and support for families.\n\n---\n\n**Moderation Toolkit:**\n\n**General Guidance:** Our community guidelines prioritize respect and factual discussion. We will hide or mute comments that are offensive, spread misinformation, or are off-topic. Block decisions are reserved for repeat offenders or egregious violations.\n\n**Reply to \"Why don't people just use electric heat?\"**\n\"Good question! Many homes in our rural area aren't set up for electric heat, and propane is often the only option. We're working within existing systems to keep families safe and warm. Thanks for asking!\"\n\n**Reply to \"This is a government problem, not a charity's.\"**\n\"We agree that systemic support is vital. In the meantime, families need immediate help. We bridge the gap while advocating for long-term solutions, working alongside partners like @KYEnergyAssist.\"",

With the first hard freeze days away, families face an impossible choice.\n\n**Character count:** 187\n\n### HOOK B (Test Option 2)\n**(1/6)** $480. That's what it costs to refill a propane tank in Coal Creek this year\u2014up 27% from last winter. For 1 in 3 households here, heat isn't guaranteed once cold hits.\n\n**Character count:** 179\n\n---\n\n**(2/6)** Propane powers heat in rural rentals across our hollers. State assistance is delayed 4\u20136 weeks. The county shutoff moratorium ends Nov 15. Families who pay rent on time still risk freezing.\n\n**Character count:** 194\n\n**(3/6)** Tasha is a home health aide and mom of two. She budgets carefully, but an unexpected car repair pushed her propane refill out of reach. Her kids shouldn't wake up cold because help is stuck in paperwork.\n\n**Character count:** 212\n\n**(4/6)** When families lose heat, kids miss school, chronic illness worsens, and ER visits climb. @CoalCountyHealth sees it every winter. This isn't about the weather\u2014it's about systems that move too slowly.\n\n**Character count:** 213\n\n**(5/6)** Coal Creek Neighbors fills the gap. We issue emergency propane vouchers directly to fuel providers\u2014no wait, no red tape. Last year we kept 140 households warm.

Propane costs jumped 27% in one year\u2014faster than wages. State assistance exists but is delayed 4\u20136 weeks. We're bridging that gap so kids stay warm.\"\n\n**Action:** Reply once, then mute thread if hostility escalates.\n\n---\n\n### Common Misinformation Response #2\n**If someone says:** *\"This is the government's job, not charity.\"*\n\n**Reply (values-aligned, 224 chars):**  \n\"You're right that systems should work. State LIHEAP funds exist but arrive 4\u20136 weeks late. The shutoff moratorium ends Nov 15. We agree policy must improve\u2014and right now, neighbors need heat. We're doing both.\"\n\n**Action:** Reply once. If constructive dialogue continues, engage briefly. Otherwise, mute.\n\n---\n\n### Escalation Guidance (Per Community Guidelines)\n\n| **Scenario** | **Action** |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Respectful disagreement or question | Reply once with facts, invite to learn more |\n| Repeated bad-faith arguments | Mute the conversation thread |\n| Personal attacks on staff/clients | Hide reply; mute or block user |\n| Hate speech, threats, or doxxing | Report to Twitter; block immediately; document for records |\n\n**Note to team:** Do not debate in replies. Respond with dignity once, then disengage. Protect client privacy\u2014never share identifying details beyond what's in the thread.\n\n---\n\n## A/B TESTING RECOMMENDATION\n\n**Test Hook A vs. Hook B** first (run each version to 50% of audience if using Twitter Ads, or post on different days organically).\n\n**Measure:**\n- Click-through rate to donation link (primary)  \n- Retweet + quote-tweet count (secondary\u2014reach)  \n- Reply sentiment (qualitative)\n\n**Test CTA A vs. CTA B** in second iteration (following week or next campaign).\n\n**Hypothesis:**  \n- Hook A (hard number first) may perform better with data-driven donors  \n- Hook B (cost emphasis) may resonate more with empathy-driven sharers  \n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n- **Tagging strategy:** @CoalCountyHealth tagged in tweet 4 for credibility on health impact. @KYEnergyAssist, @WCRadioCoal held in reserve for replies/retweets to avoid cluttering main thread. Tag them when *they* share your content.\n  \n- **Hashtag use:** #KeepCoalCreekWarm appears only in final CTA tweet (6/6) for clarity and action association. Avoid hashtag stuffing.\n\n- **Thread vs. single tweet:** This topic merits a thread due to policy context (LIHEAP delays, shutoff moratorium), human story (Tasha), and urgency (Nov 15 deadline). A single tweet would lack necessary nuance.\n\n- **Frequency:** Reserve threads for 2\u20133 high-priority campaigns per month (e.g., seasonal emergency, policy deadline, impact milestone). Use single tweets for routine updates, thank-yous, or event reminders.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared for:** Coal Creek Neighbors  \n**Campaign:** Winter Propane Emergency 2025  \n**Prepared by:** [Your comms team/consultant name]  \n**Date:** 2025-11-12",

Families stretch space heaters or go without. We help with basics\u2014food, heat, and rides to care\u2014so kids and elders stay safe.\n\n(3/6) Tasha, a home health aide and mom of two, pays her rent. Her landlord\u2019s small tank ran dry as temps fell. With LIHEAP delayed, she faced 4\u20136 weeks without heat. A $75 voucher bridged a refill so her kids slept warm.\n\n(4/6) The stakes: LIHEAP aid is delayed 4\u20136 weeks, and our county\u2019s shutoff pause ends Nov 15.

We also refer folks to @KYEnergyAssist for long\u2011term aid.\n  2) \u201cPeople should use wood or budget better.\u201d Reply: Many rentals here are propane\u2011only and lack safe wood stoves. Refills rose 27% since last winter to about $480. We focus on safety and short\u2011term help so families can get through the wait for assistance.\n\n- Community management guidance:\n  - Hide replies with personal details, shaming, or off\u2011topic attacks. \n  - Mute repeat bad\u2011faith accounts; block threats or harassment per policy. \n  - Move case discussions to DM/phone; never request private info in public replies.\n  - Report doxxing or credible threats to the platform and follow local safety protocols.\n\nNotes\n\n- Audience: local residents, small businesses, church groups in Coal Creek and nearby hollers.\n- Keep thread frequency modest (2\u20133 per month) for high\u2011importance topics; use single tweets for quick updates.",

This helps reduce overall congestion in the long run. We believe in moving everyone effectively!\"\n\n*   **Reply to common misinformation (e.g., \"Why not subway?\"):**\n    \"We absolutely need more transit options, and subways are great!

Each tweet is 180\u2013240 characters and stands alone while flowing as a story.\n\n(1/7) What would you do with 35 extra minutes a day? On Eglinton East, over 80,000 riders lose that time sitting in traffic. I\u2019m Jae Kim, Policy Director at Toronto Riders Union. Together, we can get that time back.\n\n(2/7) Right now, buses crawl behind left turns, double-parked cars, and long lights. Delays stack up from Scarborough to midtown. If you ride daily, you feel it: missed classes, late shifts, and wasted pay.\n\n(3/7) Amina is a personal support worker. She crosses the city to care for seniors, then waits as her bus sits. Some nights she misses dinner with her kids. Faster trips won\u2019t fix everything, but they help.\n\n(4/7) On Nov 28, Council votes on a 12\u2011month pilot for Eglinton East: dedicated bus lanes plus signal priority. It needs 14 YES votes. If it passes, trips get faster and more reliable. If not, the 35\u2011minute tax stays.\n\n(5/7) What works: bus\u2011only lanes, signal priority, clear paint, and fair enforcement. Cities use this to move more people per lane. Partners like @MoveTOlab and @ScarboroughTransit show how to make it work here.\n\n(6/7) Sign the petition to back Eglinton East bus lanes: https://torontoriders.ca/eglinton-east-petition?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=buslanes_vote&utm_content=awareness\n\n(7/7) Council votes Nov 28 on a 12\u2011month pilot with signal priority. I\u2019ll share the petition with Council before the vote. We need 14 YES votes. Share with a Scarborough or midtown rider today. #BusLanesTO #TransitEquity\n\n\nRights-safe, low-cost visual ideas + ALT text\n- Visual 1: Photo of a crowded 86/116 bus queued behind cars on Eglinton Ave E near Markham Rd, late-day light, brake lights visible.\n  ALT (\u2248190 chars): A packed TTC bus waits in a long line of cars on Eglinton Ave East near Markham Road at rush hour. Dozens stand on board. The bus lane is missing, and the bus can\u2019t bypass traffic, adding long delays.\n\n- Visual 2: Simple map graphic of Eglinton East corridor with proposed bus-only sections highlighted and key stops labeled (Kennedy, Kingston, UTSC).\n  ALT (\u2248200 chars): A simple map shows Eglinton Ave East from Kennedy to UTSC. The proposed bus-only lanes are highlighted. Callouts note \u201c80,000 riders/day\u201d and \u201c35 minutes lost,\u201d plus \u201c12\u2011month pilot + signal priority.\u201d\n\n- Visual 3: Close-up of a work bag and TTC Presto card at a bus stop bench (no identifiable people), with a small caption \u201cAmina\u2019s commute.\u201d\n  ALT (\u2248180 chars): A personal support worker\u2019s bag and a TTC Presto card sit on a bench at an Eglinton East bus stop. The scene suggests a long commute and waiting time without identifying the person or showing a face.\n\n\nA/B options for testing\n\nHook (use one of these for Tweet 1)\n- Option A: Toronto riders lose about 35 minutes every day on Eglinton East. That\u2019s time with family, class, and rest\u2014gone for 80,000 people. I\u2019m Jae Kim from Toronto Riders Union. There\u2019s a fix we can try now.\n- Option B: Stuck again? Daily riders on Eglinton East lose roughly 35 minutes to traffic. More than 80,000 people feel it. I\u2019m Jae Kim, Policy Director at Toronto Riders Union. Let\u2019s stop wasting your time.\n\nCTA (use one of these for Tweet 6; both include link)\n- Option A: Add your name to support Eglinton East bus lanes: https://torontoriders.ca/eglinton-east-petition?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=buslanes_vote&utm_content=awareness\n- Option B: Tell Council: vote YES for Eglinton East bus lanes: https://torontoriders.ca/eglinton-east-petition?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=buslanes_vote&utm_content=awareness\n\n\nBest timing recommendation and scheduling note\n- Post window: 8\u201310am or 12\u20131pm on weekdays for riders, students, and young professionals.\n- Your scheduled time, Tue Nov 18, 2025 at 12:15pm ET, fits the 12\u20131pm window. Recommend a reminder reply at ~5:00pm ET to catch after-work riders.\n\n\nModeration toolkit\n- Quick replies to common misinformation:\n  1) \u201cBus lanes only help a few and slow everyone else.\u201d Reply: Buses on Eglinton East move 80,000 people a day\u2014far more per lane than cars. Bus lanes with signal priority move more people, more reliably, and are part of a time\u2011limited pilot with data checks.\n  2) \u201cCrosstown will fix this, so why bother?\u201d Reply: The Crosstown doesn\u2019t serve Eglinton East. Buses remain the backbone here for years. A 12\u2011month pilot is quick to install, reversible, and helps riders now.\n\n- Hide/mute/block guidance:\n  - Hide replies with slurs, doxxing, or off\u2011topic spam.\n  - Mute repetitive bad\u2011faith accounts; engage only with honest questions.\n  - Block threats or harassment; document and report per platform rules.\n  - Keep focus on riders\u2019 time, safety, and access; avoid back\u2011and\u2011forths that derail the policy facts.\n\nNote: Toronto Riders Union champions fast, reliable, affordable transit for everyone in Toronto.

The provided schedule of **2025-12-02 9:30am ET** is excellent.\n\n---\n\n**Tweet 1 (Hook - Option A)**\n\n(1/6) Did you know vaccines prevent 3-5 million deaths each year, mostly children? This astounding number underscores their power, but millions still lack access. @GHAP_Nalini #VaccinesWork\n\n*ALT text for visual idea:* A vibrant, close-up photo of a child's hand holding a small, colorful toy, symbolizing protected childhoods. (123 chars)\n\n**Tweet 1 (Hook - Option B)**\n\n(1/6) Every $1 invested in global childhood immunization returns $21 in broader benefits. That's a powerful return, yet vital programs face funding gaps. Let's explore why. @GHAP_Nalini #VaccinesWork\n\n*ALT text for visual idea:* An infographic pie chart showing \"Health Savings,\" \"Economic Productivity,\" and \"Reduced Healthcare Burden\" sectors, all leading from a central \"Vaccine Investment.\" (194 chars)\n\n---\n\n**Tweet 2 (Problem)**\n\n(2/6) In low-resource settings, essential vaccines and primary care remain out of reach for too many children. This gap creates preventable health crises and limits community potential.\n\n*ALT text for visual idea:* A world map with highlighted regions indicating areas with significant vaccine access disparities, using muted tones. (149 chars)\n\n---\n\n**Tweet 3 (Human Story)**\n\n(3/6) People like Musa, a dedicated community health volunteer in northern Nigeria, are on the front lines, working tirelessly to reach every child. They are essential to our collective health.\n\n*ALT text for visual idea:* A respectful, dignified photo of Musa, a community health volunteer, engaging with a family in a rural setting, perhaps with a vaccine cooler nearby. (240 chars)\n\n---\n\n**Tweet 4 (What's At Stake)**\n\n(4/6) Critical U.S. funding for global childhood immunization through Gavi & UNICEF is vital for these efforts. Without sustained support, progress falters, and vulnerable communities suffer.\n\n---\n\n**Tweet 5 (What Works)**\n\n(5/6) We expand access to life-saving tools and care, but strong U.S. support is the bedrock. This investment protects children's health globally and strengthens future generations. @VaxPolicyNet @PedsHealthAssoc\n\n---\n\n**Tweet 6 (CTA - Option A)**\n\n(6/6) Now is the time to act. House & Senate appropriations markups for global health begin the week of Dec 2. Send a message to your Representative to support full funding for global vaccines in the FY26 budget! https://ghap.org/takeaction/vaccines-letter?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=fy26_gavi&utm_content=advocacy\n\n*ALT text for visual idea:* A graphic with a clear call to action: \"Contact Your Representative,\" followed by the website link and a small icon of a letter or email. (193 chars)\n\n**Tweet 6 (CTA - Option B)**\n\n(6/6) U.S. global health supporters, philanthropic donors, and policy watchers: your voice matters.

Global health organizations, including the WHO and CDC, confirm vaccines are rigorously tested & safe. They are among the most effective public health tools for protecting communities worldwide. Learn more about vaccine safety from trusted sources.\"\n*   **Guidance:** For repeated or aggressive misinformation, after a single respectful reply, hide the comment. If the user persists with harmful disinformation or hate speech, mute or block according to platform guidelines.\n\n**Common Misinformation 2: \"Global health funding should stay in the U.S.\"**\n*   **Values-aligned reply:** \"We understand concerns about domestic needs. However, investing in global health strengthens our collective security. Preventing outbreaks abroad means protecting communities at home. It's an interconnected world where global health truly is local health.\"\n*   **Guidance:** Engage once with respectful, factual information. If the user repeatedly posts xenophobic or nationalistic rhetoric, hide or mute. Block for hate speech.\n\n**General Moderation Guidance:**\n*   **Hide:** For comments that are off-topic, repetitive, or contain mild misinformation after a factual reply has been given.\n*   **Mute:** For users who are consistently negative, argumentative, or spread minor disinformation but do not engage in hate speech.\n*   **Block:** For users who consistently violate community guidelines, engage in hate speech, harassment, threats, or spread severe, dangerous disinformation.

Reply directly or ignore.\n\n---\n\n## AMPLIFICATION STRATEGY\n\n- **Tag in follow-up/retweet (not main thread):** @VaxPolicyNet, @PedsHealthAssoc, @GHAP_Nalini for credibility boost and coalition visibility.  \n- **Partner ask:** Request allied orgs retweet thread between 10am\u201312pm ET Dec 2.  \n- **Email list:** Send thread link to U.S. global health supporters list with \"Share this\" language.  \n- **LinkedIn crosspost:** Adapt tweets 1, 4, 5, 6 into a single LinkedIn post for policy watcher audience (different platform norms\u2014more text acceptable).\n\n---\n\n## A/B TESTING RECOMMENDATION\n\nRun **Hook Option A** (stat-driven) vs. **Hook Option B** (question) as separate threads to two randomly split audience segments (if email list >5,000). Track:  \n- Click-through rate to action link  \n- Replies/quotes (qualitative engagement)  \n- Retweets by target influencers  \n\nUse winning hook structure for future appropriations campaigns.\n\n---\n\n**Thread ready for review and scheduling.**",

Will the U.S. keep that momentum? I\u2019m Dr. Nalini Rao, CEO of Global Health Access Partnership. Here\u2019s why full FY26 funding for global vaccines must move now. #VaccinesWork\n\n(2/6) I\u2019m watching Congress mark up global health budgets the week of Dec 2. Early sign-ons shape final toplines. If the U.S. underfunds Gavi and UNICEF, fewer kids get basic shots, outbreaks grow, and clinic staff lose trust and time.\n\n(3/6) Musa, a community health volunteer in northern Nigeria, walks miles to remind parents of baby doses and keep the vaccine box cold. Stable funding lets Musa plan routes and reach more kids safely.\n\n(4/6) What is at stake? Lives and stability. Routine shots avert 3\u20135 million deaths each year. Every $1 invested in immunization yields about $21 in broader benefits\u2014health, schooling, and income\u2014at home and abroad. #VaccinesWork\n\n(5/6) My team at GHAP expands vaccine and primary care access in low\u2011resource settings. Gavi and UNICEF scale supply chains. With full U.S. support, partners like @VaxPolicyNet can hold coverage gains.\n\n(6/6) Act now: Urge your Representative to fully fund FY26 global vaccines: https://ghap.org/takeaction/vaccines-letter?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=fy26_gavi&utm_content=advocacy\n\n\nA/B testing options\n\nHook (Tweet 1)\n- Option A (used above): Vaccines prevent 3\u20135 million deaths each year. Will the U.S. keep that momentum? I\u2019m Dr. Nalini Rao, CEO of Global Health Access Partnership. Here\u2019s why full FY26 funding for global vaccines must move now. #VaccinesWork\n- Option B: A tool that prevents 3\u20135 million deaths a year and returns ~$21 per $1 exists: vaccines. I\u2019m Dr. Nalini Rao, CEO of Global Health Access Partnership. Congress is drafting FY26 now; evidence must lead.\n\nCTA (Tweet 6)\n- Option A (used above): Act now: Urge your Representative to fully fund FY26 global vaccines: https://ghap.org/takeaction/vaccines-letter?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=fy26_gavi&utm_content=advocacy\n- Option B: Ask your Representative to fully fund FY26 global vaccines (Gavi/UNICEF): https://ghap.org/takeaction/vaccines-letter?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=fy26_gavi&utm_content=advocacy\n\n\nSuggested visuals and ALT text (rights-safe, low-cost)\n- Photo idea: A community health volunteer in rural northern Nigeria checking a vaccine carrier with ice packs beside a mother and baby outside a clinic. ALT: Community health volunteer in northern Nigeria checks a blue vaccine cold box with ice packs while speaking with a mother holding her baby outside a modest clinic, ready for routine immunizations.\n\n- Graphic idea: Simple chart showing \u201c$1 \u2192 ~$21\u201d with labels for health, schooling, and income; small note: \u201cSources: WHO/UNICEF.\u201d ALT: Clean graphic showing that every $1 invested in vaccines yields about $21 in broader benefits, with icons for health, school attendance, and income, citing WHO/UNICEF to explain the return.\n\n- Map/infographic idea: U.S. map with \u201cTell Congress\u201d headline and a short banner \u201cFY26 Global Vaccines,\u201d plus a calendar icon for \u201cWeek of Dec 2.\u201d ALT: U.S. map graphic with the words \u201cTell Congress: Fund FY26 Global Vaccines,\u201d and a calendar icon marked \u201cWeek of Dec 2,\u201d encouraging constituents to contact their Representative.\n\n\nTiming recommendation and scheduling note\n- Best times: 8\u201310am ET or 12\u20131pm ET on weekdays.\n- Schedule this thread for Tuesday, 2025-12-02 at 9:30am ET (during expected markups). Pin the thread for the day. Consider a noon quote-tweet of the CTA (Option B) and targeted outreach to policy partners (@VaxPolicyNet, @PedsHealthAssoc) to amplify.\n\n\nModeration toolkit (values-aligned, concise replies + guidance)\n- Misinfo claim: \u201cToo many vaccines overwhelm kids\u2019 immune systems.\u201d\n  Reply: Vaccines use only a tiny fraction of a child\u2019s immune capacity. Decades of studies in millions of children show strong safety and protection. Skipping shots raises real risks from preventable diseases.\n\n- Misinfo claim: \u201cU.S. funds shouldn\u2019t go overseas.\u201d\n  Reply: Outbreaks anywhere can spread and disrupt supply chains, travel, and security. Global vaccines cost a small share of the budget and save lives while protecting Americans and our economy.\n\nGuidance:\n- Hide replies that share private health info, spam links, or off-topic politics.\n- Mute accounts that repeat debunked claims after a good-faith reply.\n- Block only for harassment, hate, or threats per community guidelines; report egregious violations.",
