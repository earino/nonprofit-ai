      "content": "Eastside Roots Community Coalition requests $45,000 from the Riverton Community Foundation Neighborhood Grants to support the Youth Farm-to-Market Apprenticeship. This grant is part of a total program budget of $78,500, serving 24 participants. Key outcomes include the completion of 60 paid hours by 22 youth (92%), 18 youth (75%) demonstrating job-readiness and food systems knowledge gains, and the distribution of 1,500 lbs of produce at low/no cost.\n\n**Personnel ($28,500)**\n*   **0.50 FTE Program Manager** at $57,000/year = $28,500. This role is responsible for program recruitment and enrollment, developing hands-on garden training curricula, coordinating nutrition and food safety workshops, overseeing weekly farm stand operations, providing mentorship and job-readiness coaching, and managing data tracking and evaluation.\n\n**Fringe Benefits ($3,420)**\nA rate of 12% is applied to the Program Manager\u2019s salary ($28,500 x 0.12 = $3,420). This covers employer payroll taxes (FICA, FUTA), and worker's compensation insurance, as per standard organizational policy.\n\n**Program Supplies ($3,000)**\n*   **Soil/Compost:** $35/yard x 40 yards = $1,400. Essential for enriching garden beds and maintaining plant health for produce growth.\n*   **Hand tools/Gloves:** $25/unit x 60 units = $1,500. Provides necessary equipment for hands-on gardening, ensuring safety and effective training for all participants.\n*   **Printing:** $0.10/page x 1,000 pages = $100. For participant handbooks, workshop materials, and outreach flyers.\n\n**Participant Stipends ($17,280)**\n*   **Stipends:** $12/hour x 60 hours x 24 youth = $17,280. This provides direct financial support for youth participants during their apprenticeship, acknowledging their time and effort in hands-on training, workshops, and farm stand operations, aligned with required timesheets.\n\n**Travel & Transportation ($3,600)**\n*   **Bus passes:** $25/month x 6 months x 24 youth = $3,600. Ensures all participants have reliable transportation to and from the community garden site and workshop locations for the duration of the program.\n\n**Facilities/Utilities ($700)**\n*   **Utilities:** Allocated based on the program's proportional use of the shared Eastside Roots office space and community garden plot. The allocation reflects the 0.5 FTE Program Manager's occupancy in a 200 sq. ft. shared space for 12 months, and direct utility usage for irrigation and workshop space connected to the garden plots. This is a fair allocation based on actual occupancy and effort.\n\n**Indirect/Admin ($3,780)**\nA 10% indirect cost rate is applied to the Modified Total Direct Costs (TDC) of $37,800 (Personnel + Fringe + Program Supplies + Travel & Transportation + Facilities/Utilities). This $3,780 covers essential administrative functions such as accounting, fundraising, human resources, and general office expenses that support the program but are not directly billed. This rate is Eastside Roots\u2019 standard historical rate for community foundation grants and avoids double-charging for items explicitly budgeted in direct cost categories.\n\n**Match/Cost Share:** 0% / $0. No match is required by the Riverton Community Foundation Neighborhood Grants for this opportunity.\n\n**Cost-Effectiveness:** The cost per participant for Riverton Community Foundation funding is $1,875 ($45,000 / 24 participants). The cost per youth completing 60 paid hours is approximately $2,045 ($45,000 / 22 youth).\n\n**Key Assumptions and Exclusions:** The budget assumes a 6-month program season (July 1, 2025 \u2013 June 30, 2026), 24 youth completing 60 hours each over 24 weekly sessions, and a 90% retention rate. The stipend rate is fixed at $12/hour. Office rent allocation is based on 0.5 FTE program staff and 200 sq. ft. of shared space. Allowability/Compliance Note: Per Riverton Community Foundation guidelines, food for participant learning is allowable; capital improvements are not; no alcohol or lobbying; participant stipends are allowable with timesheets.\n\n**Sustainability:** Post-grant, Eastside Roots will leverage the program\u2019s demonstrated success and positive community impact to diversify funding streams through additional foundation grants, individual donor events, and potential collaborations with local businesses for sponsorship of specific program components or future cohorts. Long-term goals include developing a sliding-scale community supported agriculture (CSA) model from the youth farm to generate earned income for program sustainment.\n\nThe total grant request is $45,000.\n\nPrepared by [AUTHOR NAME, TITLE].",

Expected outcomes include 22 youth (92%) completing 60 paid hours; 18 youth (75%) demonstrating measurable gains in job-readiness and food systems knowledge; and 1,500 pounds of fresh produce distributed at low or no cost to underserved neighbors.\n\n## Personnel \u2013 $34,000\n\n**Program Manager (0.50 FTE):** $54,000 annual salary \u00d7 0.50 FTE = **$27,000**. Manages all aspects of program delivery including youth recruitment and enrollment, curriculum design for nutrition and food safety workshops, supervision of weekly farm stand operations, coordination of mentorship and job-readiness coaching sessions, and data tracking and evaluation to ensure fidelity to outcomes.\n\n**Garden Educator (0.25 FTE):** $28,000 annual salary \u00d7 0.25 FTE = **$7,000**. Provides hands-on garden training in planting, weeding, watering, integrated pest management, and harvesting; delivers weekly skill-building sessions aligned with apprenticeship competencies; and ensures safe tool use and sustainable growing practices.\n\n## Fringe Benefits \u2013 $4,080\n\nFringe is calculated at **12%** of personnel costs ($34,000 \u00d7 0.12 = **$4,080**) and covers federally mandated employer contributions for FICA, Medicare, state unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation. This rate reflects our organization's standard benefit package for part-time staff.\n\n## Program Supplies \u2013 $4,020\n\n- **Soil and compost:** $35/cubic yard \u00d7 40 yards = **$1,400** to amend raised beds and maintain soil health throughout the season.\n- **Hand tools and gloves:** $25/unit \u00d7 60 units = **$1,500** (hoes, trowels, pruners, safety gloves) for 24 apprentices and instructional spares.\n- **Seeds and seedlings:** $8/packet or start \u00d7 120 varieties = **$960** for succession planting and crop diversity.\n- **Food safety supplies:** $60/month \u00d7 6 months = **$360** for sanitizer, aprons, thermometers, handwashing stations at farm stand.\n- **Printing and photocopying:** $0.10/page \u00d7 1,000 pages = **$100** for timesheets, recipes, curriculum handouts, and participant evaluations.\n- **First aid kits:** $50/kit \u00d7 4 kits = **$200** stationed at garden plots and farm stand.\n- **Signage and marketing:** $500 for bilingual farm stand posters, A-frames, and community outreach materials to attract customers and celebrate youth contributions.\n\n## Participant Stipends \u2013 $17,280\n\n**Hourly stipends:** $12/hour \u00d7 60 hours \u00d7 24 youth = **$17,280**. Apprentices earn stipends for documented work including garden labor, farm stand sales, workshops, and evaluation activities. Timesheets are required per Riverton Community Foundation allowability guidelines; stipends reduce financial barriers and recognize youth as valued contributors to the local food economy.\n\n## Travel & Transportation \u2013 $3,600\n\n**Bus passes:** $25/month \u00d7 6 months \u00d7 24 youth = **$3,600**. Provides public transit access from participants' East Side neighborhoods to the garden site and weekly farm stand, ensuring equitable participation regardless of household vehicle access.\n\n## Facilities/Utilities \u2013 $2,520\n\nAllocated costs reflect **200 square feet** of shared program space (tool storage, curriculum prep, washroom) and utilities attributable to **0.50 FTE program staff** effort. Monthly allocation of $420 \u00d7 6 months = **$2,520**. Calculation is based on pro-rata share of our 2,000 sq. ft. leased facility ($3,000/month rent + $600/month utilities) and is consistent with our cost allocation plan approved by prior funders.\n\n## Indirect/Admin \u2013 $3,500\n\nIndirect costs are calculated at **10% of Total Direct Costs** ($35,000 TDC = personnel + fringe; excludes participant stipends per foundation guidance) = **$3,500**. This negotiated rate, accepted by previous foundation and government awards, covers non-duplicated finance, human resources, IT support, liability insurance, audit preparation, and executive oversight. Direct program costs (supplies, facilities) are separately budgeted to avoid double-charging.\n\n---\n\n**Match/Cost Share:** None required. **$0 / 0%**. Sources: N/A. Status: N/A. In-kind contributions (volunteer time, donated tools) are tracked per 2 CFR 200.306 valuation standards but are not counted toward this award.\n\n**Cost-Effectiveness:** Cost per participant = $45,000 \u00f7 24 youth = **$1,875**. Cost per completer (22 youth) = **$2,045**. Cost per youth gaining job-readiness skills (18 youth) = **$2,500**.\n\n**Key Assumptions:** Six-month season (April\u2013September 2026); 24 youth completing 60 hours each; 24 weekly garden and farm stand sessions; 90% retention; stipend rate fixed at $12/hour; facilities allocation based on 0.5 FTE program staff and 200 sq. ft. shared space.\n\n**Exclusions:** Capital improvements, equipment >$5,000 unit cost, alcohol, lobbying (per foundation guidelines).\n\n**Sustainability:** Post-grant, we will seek city youth employment contracts, earned revenue from expanded farm stand sales (projected $8,000 annually), and integration into our general operating budget supported by individual donors and United Way allocations.\n\n**Compliance:** Per Riverton Community Foundation guidelines, food for participant learning is allowable; capital improvements are not; participant stipends require documented timesheets.\n\n**Total Request: $45,000** (Personnel $34,000 + Fringe $4,080 + Supplies $4,020 + Stipends $17,280 + Travel $3,600 + Facilities $2,520 + Indirect $3,500).

Key outcomes include: 96 participants (80%) completing training; 84 (70%) earning an industry credential (CompTIA A+ or Google IT Support); and 78 (65%) placed in IT roles within 90 days at a median $22/hour.\n\n**Salaries & Wages**\nThis category supports 4.2 FTE essential for participant outreach, intensive training, and job placement.\n* Program Manager: 0.50 FTE at $78,000 = $39,000. Duties: Program oversight, partner coordination, data reporting.\n* IT Instructor: 1.0 FTE at $70,000 = $70,000. Duties: Delivering 240-hour IT training (classroom and virtual), certification preparation.\n* Case Manager: 1.0 FTE at $60,000 = $60,000. Duties: Participant screening, individualized case management, support services coordination.\n* Job Developer/Coach: 1.0 FTE at $65,000 = $65,000. Duties: Employer engagement, internship placement, job development, mock interviews, retention coaching.\n* Program Assistant: 0.70 FTE at $45,000 = $31,500. Duties: Outreach support, scheduling, administrative tasks.\nTotal Salaries & Wages: $265,500\n\n**Employee Benefits**\nA rate of 24% of salaries covers health insurance, dental, vision, payroll taxes (FICA, FUTA, SUTA), and workers\u2019 compensation for all salaried staff.\nTotal Employee Benefits: $265,500 x 0.24 = $63,720\n\n**Program Supplies & Software**\nThis category ensures participants have necessary tools and access to learning platforms.\n* Certification vouchers: CompTIA A+ ($246 x 100) = $24,600 (assumes 75% first-attempt pass rate, allowing for re-takes); Google IT Support ($49 x 60) = $2,940.\n* Laptop loaners: $525 x 40 = $21,000 (for participants without personal computers).\n* LinkedIn Learning licenses: $25/user x 120 = $3,000 (providing supplemental learning resources).\nTotal Program Supplies & Software: $51,540\n\n**Participant Supports**\nDirect financial assistance to reduce barriers to participation and employment.\n* Transportation supports: $60/month x 6 months x 120 participants = $43,200. Covers public transit or fuel for participants for training duration and initial job search.\n* Childcare stipends: $200/month x 4 months x 40 participants = $32,000 (for approximately 1/3 of participants who require childcare).\nTotal Participant Supports: $75,200\n\n**Professional Services**\nEngaging external expertise to enhance program quality.\n* Employer Panelists/Guest Speakers: $200/event x 6 events = $1,200 (honoraria for industry experts providing insights and mock interviews).\n* Professional Development Training for Staff: $500 x 2 staff = $1,000 (e.g., trauma-informed care, advanced IT skills).\nTotal Professional Services: $2,200\n\n**Travel**\nMileage reimbursement and local transportation costs for staff performing outreach and employer visits.\n* Local staff travel for employer site visits and outreach: 500 miles/month x $0.67/mile x 12 months = $4,020.\nTotal Travel: $4,020\n\n**Facilities**\nShared operational costs for program delivery.\n* Rent and Utilities: Allocated based on staff FTE (4.2 FTE out of 10 total staff) and classroom hours (20% of building usage). $30,000 x 0.35 = $10,500. This is a fair allocation reflecting the program's use of office and classroom space.\nTotal Facilities: $10,500\n\n**Evaluation**\nExternal assessment to validate program outcomes and inform continuous improvement.\n* External Evaluator: $5,000 (comprehensive data analysis and reporting on participant outcomes, credential attainment, and job placement rates).\nTotal Evaluation: $5,000\n\n**Indirect/Admin**\nA standard indirect rate of 12% is applied to the Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC), excluding equipment above $5,000, participant support costs, and subawards over $25,000. Our MTDC (Salaries & Wages + Employee Benefits + Program Supplies & Software (excl. laptops) + Professional Services + Travel + Facilities + Evaluation) = $265,500 + $63,720 + $30,540 + $2,200 + $4,020 + $10,500 + $5,000 = $381,480.\n* Indirect Costs: $381,480 x 0.12 = $45,777.60. The Bank of America Charitable Foundation allows indirect costs up to 15%. This rate, derived from our audited indirect cost rate, covers general organizational administration, finance, human resources, and IT infrastructure necessary for program success, avoiding double-charging for direct administrative personnel.\nTotal Indirect/Admin: $45,778\n\n**Cost-Effectiveness:**\nThe total program cost is $420,000 for 120 participants, resulting in a cost per participant of $3,500. With 78 participants placed in IT roles, the cost per successful placement is approximately $5,385.\n\n**Match/Cost Share:**\nNo formal match is required by the Bank of America Charitable Foundation. TechBridge Workforce Alliance is providing a voluntary cost share of 20% ($84,000). This includes:\n* Cash: United Way Workforce Grant ($50,000, committed).\n* In-kind: Employer mentors and mock interviewers (1,360 hours x $25/hour = $34,000, pending MOUs). In-kind valuation is based on standard professional rates for similar services.\n\n**Key Assumptions and Exclusions:**\n* Two cohorts of 60 participants each will be served over the grant period.\n* An average of 75% exam pass rate on the first attempt for industry certifications is assumed.\n* Transportation support is provided for 6 months per participant.\n* Childcare support is provided for approximately one-third of participants (40 individuals).\n* Staffing is at 4.2 FTE across instruction, case management, and job placement.\n* All grant funds ($150,000) are requested for expenses in appropriate categories.\n\n**Sustainability:**\nUpon completion of this grant, TechBridge Workforce Alliance plans to sustain the program through a diversified funding approach. We will seek additional grants from other foundations, cultivate corporate partnerships for direct sponsorship and talent pipeline development, and explore fee-for-service opportunities with employers. The strong outcomes demonstrated will be crucial in securing ongoing support and reducing reliance on individual grants over time.\n\nSee Bank of America grantmaking guidelines (indirect typically \u226415%; equipment under $5,000 allowed; no lobbying): https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/grantmaking-guidelines.\n\nPrepared by [AUTHOR NAME, TITLE].",

Key outcomes include 150 trainees earning FFT2/Red Card certification, 120 individuals placed in forestry/wildland jobs within six months of training, and the support of treatments on 5,000 acres through crew deployments and partner projects.\n\n**Personnel ($1,155,000)**\n*   **0.50 FTE Program Manager at $95,000 = $47,500:** Oversees overall program implementation, recruitment strategies in rural communities, and establishment of employer partnerships.\n*   **1.0 FTE Training Coordinator at $75,000 = $75,000:** Develops and delivers field safety, sawyer training, prescribed burn support, and manages certifications and work-based learning.\n*   **3.0 FTE Crew Supervisors at $65,000 x 3 = $195,000:** Leads and supervises three 10-person crews during deployment, ensuring safety and adherence to treatment protocols.\n*   **6.0 FTE Training Instructors at $60,000 x 6 = $360,000:** Delivers specialized training in FFT2/Red Card, sawyer skills, field safety, and prescribed fire.\n*   **10.0 FTE Outreach & Placement Specialists at $50,000 x 10 = $500,000:** Focuses on recruitment in rural communities, building employer partnerships, and job placement for trainees.\n*   **0.50 FTE Data & Reporting Analyst at $75,000 = $37,500:** Manages participant tracking, outcome monitoring, and prepares required reports.\n\n**Fringe Benefits ($346,500)**\nFringe benefits are budgeted at 30% of personnel salaries, covering FICA, health insurance, unemployment insurance, and worker\u2019s compensation. ($1,155,000 x 0.30 = $346,500).\n\n**Travel ($169,920)**\nTravel will cover per diem for staff during training and field deployments. Per diem: $59/day x 80 days/year x 3 years x 12 staff = $169,920 (GSA CONUS per diem rate used).\n\n**Equipment ($103,000)**\n*   **Towable chippers (equipment >$5,000): $32,000 x 2 = $64,000:** Essential for efficiently processing woody debris on treatment sites.\n*   **All-terrain vehicles: $9,750 x 4 = $39,000:** Facilitates access to remote and rugged treatment areas for crews.\n\n**Supplies ($208,000)**\n*   **PPE kits: $450 x 180 = $81,000:** Provides individual safety gear for all trainees.\n*   **Chainsaws: $650 x 60 = $39,000:** Necessary tools for sawyer training and field operations.\n*   **Hand tools (rakes, shovels, pulaskis): $150 x 180 = $27,000:** Basic tools for manual fuel reduction and fire line construction.\n*   **First aid kits & safety supplies: $200 x 30 = $6,000:** Ensures crew safety and immediate response to injuries.\n*   **Training materials & manuals: $75 x 180 = $13,500:** Supports comprehensive instruction for all certification programs.\n*   **Fuel for vehicles & equipment: $1,400/month x 36 months = $50,400:** Powers crew trucks and heavy equipment during operations.\n\n**Contractual ($124,200)**\n*   **Crew truck rentals: $1,100/month x 6 months/year x 3 years x 4 trucks = $79,200:** Provides reliable transportation for four crews to and from project sites.\n*   **FFT2/Red Card Certification services: $250 x 150 = $37,500:** Covers the cost of professional certification oversight.\n*   **Workforce recruitment marketing: $250/month x 36 months = $7,500:** Targeted outreach to rural communities to attract participants.\n\n**Other ($45,000)**\n*   **Evaluation contractor: $150/hour x 300 hours = $45,000:** Engages an independent evaluator to assess program effectiveness, participant outcomes, and job placement rates.\n\n**Indirect Costs ($252,380)**\nNorthern Sierra Conservancy includes indirect costs at an audited rate of 17.5% of Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC). This rate has been approved by our cognizant agency and applies to services such as general administration, human resources, payroll, and grant management directly supporting this program. This ensures proper allocation of shared administrative burden and avoids double-charging. (MTDC excludes equipment >$5,000, portions of subawards >$25,000, and participant support). Calculation: ($1,155,000 [Personnel] + $346,500 [Fringe] + $169,920 [Travel] + $39,000 [Eq. <$5k] + $208,000 [Supplies] + $124,200 [Contractual] + $45,000 [Other]) x 0.175 = $252,380.\n\n**Shared/Allocated Costs:** Shared services (HR, finance, IT) are allocated by program FTE to ensure fair distribution based on the human resources intensity of the project. Office square footage allocated to the program is based on the proportion of program staff occupying the facilities. Vehicle insurance is allocated by the number of program vehicles and anticipated miles driven, reflecting direct program usage.\n\n**Match/Cost Share ($800,000)**\nNorthern Sierra Conservancy will provide a 25% match of $800,000.\n*   **Cash:** CAL FIRE Workforce Grant: $500,000 (committed).\n*   **In-kind:** Volunteer Fire Departments training time: 12,000 hours x $25/hour = $300,000 (pending MOUs; valued per 2 CFR 200.306 for volunteer services at professional rates).\n\n**Cost-Effectiveness & Sustainability**\nThe Forest Resilience Corps aims for significant cost-effectiveness with a projected cost per participant of approximately $17,778 ($3,200,000 / 180 participants). The cost per outcome for a placed trainee is approximately $26,667 ($3,200,000 / 120 placements). Post-grant, the program will leverage established employer relationships and continue to seek diverse funding streams, including state workforce development grants, private foundation support, and fee-for-service contracts for specialized crew work, allowing for continued operation and potential expansion. We anticipate efficiency gains as processes are streamlined and the program gains recognition.\n\n**Key Assumptions and Exclusions:** This budget assumes 6 crews of 10 members per season operating over 3 operating seasons. An 85% trainee retention rate is assumed. GSA CONUS per diem rates are applied. MTDC excludes equipment costing over $5,000, the portion of subawards exceeding $25,000, and participant support costs. Total requested $2,400,000; total program budget $3,200,000.\n\n**Allowability/Compliance Notes:** All costs are budgeted in accordance with Federal allowability per 2 CFR 200: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200 and CWDG program guidance: https://www.fs.usda.gov/science-technology/cwdg.\n\nPrepared by [Jane Doe, Grants Manager].",
