We believe every person deserves consistent access to healthy food, regardless of their zip code.\n\nFounded in 2017, Southside Fresh Food Collaborative began with a clear mission: to address the severe lack of fresh, affordable produce in Chicago\u2019s South Side communities. Residents faced numerous barriers to healthy eating, from distant grocery stores to limited transportation and economic hardships. We set out to build a community-driven solution, ensuring that fresh food was not a luxury, but an accessible right for our neighbors.\n\nToday, we deliver vital food access programs and educational opportunities in Chicago\u2019s South Side neighborhoods of Englewood, Back of the Yards, and Washington Park. Our services include a weekly mobile produce pantry, a network of six community fridge locations, and hands-on assistance with enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We also offer engaging youth garden apprenticeships and host nutrition workshops in partnership with local clinics. These initiatives collectively serve over 1,250 individuals each year, directly bringing fresh food and food literacy to those who need it most.\n\n**Our Impact:**\n*   In 2024, we distributed 428,000 pounds of fresh food through our pantry logs.\n*   In 2023, 82% of surveyed participants reported eating fruits and vegetables four or more days per week after participating in our programs for eight weeks (participant surveys, n=312).\n*   From 2022\u20132024, 95% of 610 SNAP applications submitted with our assistance were approved within 60 days (state verification).\n\n**What Guides Us:**\n*   **Dignity First:** We treat every community member with respect and prioritize their choices.\n*   **Community Leadership:** Programs are co-designed with resident councils, ensuring they meet neighborhood needs.\n*   **Cultural Relevance:** Our food offerings and educational content reflect the diverse cultures of the communities we serve.\n*   **Accountability:** We rigorously measure outcomes quarterly to adjust and improve our services.\n*   **Sustainability:** We hire directly from the neighborhoods we serve, building local capacity and leadership.\n\n**Trusted Partnerships:**\nWe are a proud partner agency of Feeding America, operating locally through the Greater Chicago Food Depository.

Corner stores stocked processed foods, and grocery chains had abandoned the area. We launched to bring the food to the people\u2014and to let the community lead the solutions.\n\n**What We Do**  \nWe serve approximately 1,250 people each year across Englewood, Back of the Yards, and Washington Park through five core programs. Our weekly mobile produce pantry brings fresh fruits, vegetables, and staples directly into neighborhoods. We maintain a network of six community fridges stocked daily with grab-and-go meals and produce. Our staff provides SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) enrollment assistance to help families access federal nutrition benefits. Youth garden apprenticeships train young people in urban agriculture and food justice. We also offer nutrition workshops in partnership with local clinics, meeting people where they already receive care.\n\n**Our Impact**  \nIn 2024, we distributed 428,000 pounds of fresh food (pantry logs). In 2023, 82% of surveyed participants reported eating fruits and vegetables four or more days per week after eight weeks in our programs (participant surveys, n=312). From 2022 to 2024, 95% of the 610 SNAP applications we submitted were approved within 60 days (state verification).\n\n**How We Work**  \n- **Dignity first** \u2013 No proof of income, no waiting lists, no judgment  \n- **Community leadership** \u2013 Residents co-design programs through neighborhood councils  \n- **Cultural relevance** \u2013 We source collard greens, nopales, and foods that reflect who lives here  \n- **Accountability** \u2013 Quarterly outcome reviews adjust services in real time  \n- **Sustainability** \u2013 We hire from the neighborhood and build long-term local capacity  \n\n**Partnerships and Recognition**  \nWe're a Feeding America partner agency through the Greater Chicago Food Depository and collaborate with Chicago Park District, Friend Health Centers, and other trusted institutions.

We set out to bridge these gaps, believing that digital equity is fundamental to a thriving community.\n\nToday, we serve 12 counties across Eastern Kentucky and Southern West Virginia. Our programs directly benefit over 6,800 individuals each year. We offer broadband planning and grant technical assistance to help local governments secure internet infrastructure. We refurbish and distribute essential digital devices. Our digital skills courses, typically 20 to 40 hours long, equip residents with practical tools for work and life. We also provide small business e-commerce training and telehealth navigator services in rural clinics, ensuring everyone can use digital tools effectively.\n\n## Impact Snapshot\n\n*   From 2022\u20132024, we secured **$18.7 million in public broadband investments** for partner counties (grant award letters).\n*   In 2024, **1,850 residents completed digital skills courses**, with 72% reporting new employment or wage gains within 6 months (post-course surveys, n=1,214).\n*   Since 2021, we have **distributed 3,200 refurbished laptops** with a 98% 90-day functionality rate (asset tracking logs).\n\n## Our Approach\n\n*   **Equity:** We work tirelessly to ensure everyone has fair access to digital resources, regardless of their location or income.\n*   **Practical Results:** Our programs are designed for clear, measurable outcomes that directly benefit individuals and communities.\n*   **Transparency:** We openly share our data and progress, fostering trust with our partners and the communities we serve.\n*   **Regional Collaboration:** We believe in working together, building local coalitions, and transferring knowledge to sustain programs.\n\n## Credibility Cues\n\nMountain Connect Alliance is an affiliate of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) and a valued Appalachian Regional Commission grantee. We are also a Microsoft Airband community partner and hold Memoranda of Understanding with 14 public libraries. In 2022, we received the Kentucky Nonprofit Network Excellence in Advocacy Award, followed by the 2023 West Virginia Department of Economic Development Community Impact Award.\n\nLearn more about our work at https://mountainconnectalliance.org/programs, meet our dedicated team at https://mountainconnectalliance.org/team, and review our progress in our latest report at https://mountainconnectalliance.org/reports/2024-annual-report.pdf.\n\nDonate today to help us expand digital access across Appalachia: https://mountainconnectalliance.org/donate",

Families couldn't apply for jobs online. Students couldn't complete homework. Telehealth didn't exist in most counties. We were founded to solve that: building the infrastructure, training, and partnerships needed to bring our region into the digital age.\n\n**What We Do**  \nToday, we serve 12 counties across Eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, reaching more than 6,800 people each year. Our work includes broadband planning and grant technical assistance for counties, device refurbishment and distribution, digital skills courses (20\u201340 hours), small business e-commerce training, and telehealth navigator services in rural clinics. We meet people where they are\u2014whether that's a county courthouse, a public library, or a health department waiting room.\n\n**Our Impact**  \nFrom 2022\u20132024, we secured $18.7 million in public broadband investments for partner counties (grant award letters). In 2024, 1,850 residents completed digital skills courses, with 72% reporting new employment or wage gains within six months (post-course surveys, n=1,214). Since 2021, we have distributed 3,200 refurbished laptops with a 98% 90-day functionality rate (asset tracking logs).\n\n**How We Work**  \n- **Equity**: We prioritize residents with the fewest resources and greatest barriers.  \n- **Practical results**: Every program is designed around job access, health outcomes, or education gains.  \n- **Regional collaboration**: We build coalitions across county lines and transfer capacity to local governments and libraries.  \n- **Transparency**: We publish open data dashboards and train local staff to sustain programs beyond our involvement.  \n- **Data-driven planning**: Decisions are based on community surveys, infrastructure maps, and usage metrics\u2014not assumptions.\n\n**Partnerships & Recognition**  \nWe are a National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) affiliate, Appalachian Regional Commission grantee, and Microsoft Airband community partner, with memoranda of understanding with 14 public libraries. Recent honors include the 2022 Kentucky Nonprofit Network Excellence in Advocacy Award and the 2023 West Virginia Department of Economic Development Community Impact Award.\n\n**Learn More**  \nExplore our [programs](https://mountainconnectalliance.org/programs), meet the [team](https://mountainconnectalliance.org/team), or read our [2024 Annual Report](https://mountainconnectalliance.org/reports/2024-annual-report.pdf).\n\n[**Donate today**](https://mountainconnectalliance.org/donate) to help more families connect to opportunity.",

We deliver practical broadband planning, digital skills training, and affordable devices so people can work, learn, and access care.\n\nOrigin\nWe were founded in 2010 by local leaders who saw neighbors shut out of jobs, school, and healthcare because reliable, affordable internet and skills were out of reach. Early efforts revealed fragmented planning and scarce capacity at the county level. We set out to solve those gaps with regional coordination, clear data, and hands-on support.\n\nWhat we do now\nToday, we serve 6,800 people each year across 12 counties in Eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, focusing on students, job seekers, older adults, small business owners, and patients in rural clinics. Our programs include: broadband planning and grant technical assistance for counties; device refurbishment and distribution; 20\u201340 hour digital skills courses; small business e\u2011commerce training; and telehealth navigator services embedded in rural clinics.

We believe that learning to code equips students with essential skills for personal growth and future career opportunities.\n\nOur journey began in 2004. We saw a gap in equitable access to computer science education, especially for students from underserved communities. Many young people lacked the resources and opportunities to learn these critical skills. We set out to change that, determined to create pathways for all students to explore and excel in the world of technology.\n\nToday, BrightPath delivers comprehensive coding education and support services. We offer after-school coding clubs for students in grades 6\u201312, immersive summer bootcamps, and professional development for teachers. We also facilitate internship matching with tech employers and provide laptop and hotspot lending to ensure all students can participate. Our programs reach over 85,000 young people annually across 18 metropolitan areas nationwide, with key hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle.\n\n## Our Impact\n\nWe are committed to creating lasting change through our programs:\n\n*   In the 2023\u20132024 school year, 83% of club participants completed a multi-week project and advanced at least one course level (program records, n=41,326).\n*   Since 2004, we have delivered 1.2 million hours of instruction and reviewed 450,000 project submissions (learning platform analytics).\n*   In 2024, 68% of eligible seniors in bootcamps reported enrolling in a computing major or credential within 6 months (graduate follow-up survey, n=2,118).\n\n## Our Approach\n\n*   **Youth Voice:** We co-create curricula with students and educators, ensuring our programs are relevant and engaging.\n*   **Inclusion:** We provide stipends and wraparound supports to reduce barriers to participation.\n*   **Real-world Relevance:** Our projects and partnerships connect learning directly to future opportunities.\n*   **Continuous Learning:** We publish open-source projects so schools can reuse what works and adapt it to their needs.\n\n## Our Partners\n\nWe are proud to work alongside organizations like Boys & Girls Clubs of America, city school districts in 12 cities, and corporate partners including Google.org and Adobe.

We provide free coding education, mentorship, and technology access to young people nationwide.\n\n## Why We Started\n\nIn 2004, our founders saw talented students\u2014mostly Black, Latinx, and from low-income families\u2014systematically locked out of computer science opportunities. Schools lacked equipment, trained teachers, and culturally responsive curricula. Students couldn't envision themselves in tech because they'd never met someone who looked like them writing code. We set out to change that by bringing high-quality coding instruction directly into communities, not waiting for systems to catch up.\n\n## What We Do\n\nToday, BrightPath operates in 18 metropolitan areas across the United States, with hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. We serve approximately 85,000 young people each year through after-school coding clubs (grades 6\u201312), summer immersion bootcamps, teacher professional development, internship matching with tech employers, and laptop and hotspot lending. Our programs meet students where they are\u2014in community centers, libraries, and schools\u2014and provide the tools, instruction, and support they need to succeed.\n\n## Our Impact\n\nIn the 2023\u20132024 school year, 83% of club participants completed a multi-week project and advanced at least one course level (program records, n=41,326).\n\nSince 2004, we've delivered 1.2 million hours of instruction and reviewed 450,000 project submissions (learning platform analytics).\n\nIn 2024, 68% of eligible seniors in bootcamps reported enrolling in a computing major or credential within six months (graduate follow-up survey, n=2,118).\n\n## How We Work\n\n- **Youth voice:** We co-create curricula with students and educators so learning reflects their interests and goals.\n- **Inclusion:** We offer stipends and wraparound supports\u2014transportation, meals, childcare\u2014so economic barriers don't block participation.\n- **Real-world relevance:** Students build projects that matter to them and connect with tech professionals doing the work.\n- **Continuous learning:** We publish open-source projects so schools can reuse what works and reach more students.\n\n## Who Stands With Us\n\nBrightPath is a site partner with Boys & Girls Clubs of America and collaborates with city school districts in 12 cities. Corporate partners include Google.org and Adobe. We hold a Candid (GuideStar) Platinum Transparency Seal and a Charity Navigator 4-star rating.

We partner with communities to remove barriers and turn interest into opportunity.\n\nOur beginning\nWe started in 2004 to address a clear gap: most middle and high school students\u2014especially outside well-resourced schools\u2014had few chances to learn coding, collaborate on real projects, or access a reliable device and internet. A small group of educators and technologists launched after-school clubs and device lending to make quality learning possible after the bell. The goal was simple then and now: meet youth where they are and open durable pathways into tech and related careers.\n\nWhat we do today\nWe serve 85,000 learners each year through after-school coding clubs (grades 6\u201312), summer immersion bootcamps, teacher professional development, internship matching with tech employers, and laptop and hotspot lending. We operate in 18 metropolitan areas across the United States, with hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. We work with students, educators, and families to build projects that matter locally\u2014apps, games, data stories\u2014and to connect advanced learners with paid, real-world experiences.\n\nImpact snapshot\n- In the 2023\u20132024 school year, 83% of club participants completed a multi-week project and advanced at least one course level (program records, n=41,326).\n- Since 2004, 1.2 million hours of instruction delivered and 450,000 project submissions reviewed (learning platform analytics).\n- In 2024, 68% of eligible seniors in bootcamps reported enrolling in a computing major or credential within 6 months (graduate follow-up survey, n=2,118).\n\nValues and approach\n- Youth voice: Students shape themes, tools, and showcase events.\n- Inclusion: Welcoming spaces, accessible materials, and supports for diverse learners.\n- Real-world relevance: Portfolios, internships, and community use cases drive learning.\n- Continuous learning: We use data and feedback to improve every cycle.\n- We co-create curricula with students and educators, offer stipends and wraparound supports, and publish open-source projects so schools can reuse what works.\n\nCredibility\nSite partners include Boys & Girls Clubs of America and city school districts in 12 cities. Corporate partners include Google.org and Adobe. Recognition and transparency: Candid (GuideStar) Platinum Transparency Seal; Charity Navigator 4\u2011star rating; 2023 Fast Company World Changing Ideas honoree (Education category); 2021 National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) AspireIT Impact Award.\n\nLearn more: Programs https://brightpathcoding.org/programs | Team https://brightpathcoding.org/team | Annual Report https://brightpathcoding.org/reports/2024-annual-report.pdf\n\nSubscribe for stories, data, and ways to get involved: https://brightpathcoding.org/subscribe",
