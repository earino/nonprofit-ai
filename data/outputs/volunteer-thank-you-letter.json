          "The phrase 'kept the work organized and safe' in paragraph 1 is somewhat generic; could be more specific to wetland restoration context",
          "Minor awkwardness: 'TEAM LEAD' appears in all caps when it should be title case for formal tone",
          "The signature accessibility note ('Signature of Elena Kovacs included for accessibility') is slightly awkward phrasing for print context\u2014could simply state the alt-text or omit the explanation"
