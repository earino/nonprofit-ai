Apply consistently.\n\nQuality: Be concrete, local, and human-centered; avoid clich\u00e9s, guilt language, and heavy jargon. Protect dignity and privacy (first names/consent if used). The goal is steady stewardship that sets up future asks and reduces unsubscribes through value-first content.",

Each box included 12\u201315 pounds of produce, shelf-stable staples, and protein (chicken, eggs, or beans).\n\nThat's **12,400 pounds of food** staying local and reaching the people who need it most.\n\n**Rosa's Story:**  \nRosa, a single mom in Toppenish, works seasonal apple harvest while raising three kids under 10. She told us the weekly protein in our boxes means her children eat scrambled eggs for breakfast instead of skipping it. \"I don't have to choose between gas and groceries anymore,\" she said.

Your support helped midwives and community teams turn training into real outcomes for mothers and babies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nThis month\n- Two metrics: In November, 48 midwives completed Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) neonatal resuscitation in Nairobi and Arusha; 612 women attended group antenatal care across Kisumu and Tanga.\n- Vignette: Amina, 22, delivered at a county clinic near Tanga. Her son needed help to start breathing. Midwife Jane, who trained at the Nairobi Summit, used a bag\u2011mask and simple steps. He cried within one minute. Amina asked us to share her thanks\u2014first names used with consent.\n\n[PHOTO PLACEHOLDER: Midwives practicing bag\u2011mask ventilation at Nairobi Midwife Training Summit 2025.
