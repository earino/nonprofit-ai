          "Some repetitive language across segments: The phrase 'Relive moments'/'See more moments'/'See the magic' and the identical Maya highlight description could be varied more for authenticity",

We hope you enjoyed witnessing the collective efforts to protect our precious coastline. Your presence added to the wonderful community spirit of the day.\n\nWe're excited to share just a few results of everyone's hard work on September 21st:\n\n*   **18.2 tons of trash** removed from the Massachusetts shoreline.\n*   More than **2,350 community members** participated.\n*   \"I came for extra credit and left caring about every piece of plastic.\" \u2014 Tiana, 11th grader.\n\nA truly special highlight was when a bald eagle flew over the harbor as the final trash bin was weighed, perfectly encapsulating the beauty we strive to protect. You can see more memorable moments in our photo gallery:\n\n*   Volunteers sorting debris at Long Wharf\n    [https://baystatecoastal.org/photos/cleanup2025-1.jpg](https://baystatecoastal.org/photos/cleanup2025-1.jpg)\n*   Kids holding data cards at tidepool station\n    [https://baystatecoastal.org/photos/cleanup2025-2.jpg](https://baystatecoastal.org/photos/cleanup2025-2.jpg)\n\nA big thank you to our generous sponsors, including REI Co-op and Harbor Credit Union, who make events like this possible.\n\nWe appreciate your interest in coastal stewardship.
