Our primary beneficiaries are Black and Latine households utilizing SNAP benefits, caregivers with children under 12, and seniors, groups disproportionately affected by food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. This program is rooted in the understanding that improving health equity requires a multi-faceted approach, moving beyond simply providing food to empowering communities with the knowledge and skills to make healthy choices sustainably.\n\nOur rationale is simple: **if** we provide culturally relevant, affordable, and accessible fresh produce through a mobile market, **and if** we offer hands-on, community-led cooking education that is culturally affirming and accessible, **then** residents will be better equipped to integrate healthy eating into their daily lives, reducing food insecurity and improving long-term health outcomes. Our equity approach is central to this model: intentionally locating services in food deserts, accepting SNAP/EBT with matching incentives, offering bilingual (English/Spanish) programming, and centering the lived experiences and culinary traditions of Black and Latine communities. We avoid deficit framing by focusing on building community assets and strengths.\n\nKey assumptions include consistent access to quality produce, community trust in the Collaborative as a reliable partner, participant willingness to engage in new food preparation methods, and stable public transportation access for non-mobile market participants. This logic model will guide implementation by providing a clear roadmap for our small team of four, ensuring activities are directly linked to desired outcomes. It will also serve as a crucial framework for evaluation, allowing us to track progress against measurable indicators, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate accountability to our community and funders. By disaggregating data by race, zip code, and primary language, we can ensure our interventions are reaching and effectively serving our target populations. This systematic approach ensures we are not just delivering services, but driving meaningful, equitable change.\n\n***\n\n**Note on Logic Model vs. Theory of Change:** This logic model provides a visual, sequential flow of program components from inputs to impact. A theory of change, while encompassing similar elements, typically offers a broader narrative explaining the underlying assumptions, beliefs, and causal pathways for *why* and *how* change is expected to occur in a more expansive social and political context.\n\n***\n\n### Southside Food & Wellness Collaborative: Mobile Market & Cooking Circles Logic Model Framework\n\n| Inputs (Resources) | Activities (What we do) | Outputs (Direct Products/Services) | Short-term Outcomes (6\u201312 mo) | Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 yrs) | Long-term Outcomes/Impact (3+ yrs) | Indicators & Targets | Data Sources & Frequency | Responsible Role | Assumptions/External Factors | Equity Considerations |\n| :----------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------ |\n| **Financial:** $180k-$240k budget (grants, donations, sales) | **Mobile Market Operations:** Source fresh produce;

(Disaggregated by race/ethnicity, caregiver/senior status, primary language)\n\n---\n\n### Top 3 Assumptions & Risks/External Factors:\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n1.  **Community Trust & Engagement:** Residents in target areas will trust the program's intentions and offerings, leading to consistent participation in both mobile markets and cooking circles.\n2.  **Consistent Produce Supply & Quality:** The Collaborative can consistently source high-quality, affordable, and culturally relevant fresh produce that meets community preferences.\n3.  **Participant Readiness & Resources:** Participants have the basic resources (e.g., transportation capacity for non-mobile market participation, kitchen access, time) and willingness to actively engage in learning new cooking skills and integrating healthy foods.\n\n**Risks/External Factors & Mitigation:**\n\n1.  **Risk: Fluctuating Food Prices/Supply Chain Disruptions:**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Diversify produce sourcing (local farms, wholesalers); build contingency budget for price fluctuations (5-10% buffer); communicate transparently with participants about any changes.\n2.  **Risk: Low Program Uptake/Engagement:**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct ongoing community feedback sessions; adapt market locations/times and cooking circle themes based on participant input; strengthen partnerships with trusted community anchor institutions; bilingual, culturally competent outreach.\n3.  **Risk: Policy Changes Impacting SNAP/EBT Incentives or Food Assistance Programs:**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Advocate through local coalitions for continued support; explore alternative funding streams for incentives; keep participants informed of policy changes and connect them to advocacy efforts.\n\n---\n\n### Review Cadence & Update Triggers:\n\n*   **Quarterly Review:** Program Manager, Market Coordinator, Cooking Class Coordinator, Outreach Specialist will meet quarterly to review progress against indicators, analyze participant feedback, and identify operational efficiencies/challenges.\n*   **Update Triggers:**\n    *   Significant staffing shifts (addition/loss of team member)\n    *   Major policy changes affecting food assistance programs or local health initiatives\n    *   Indicators consistently underperforming or overperforming targets by >20%\n    *   Unforeseen external factors (e.g., natural disasters, significant economic downturns) impacting the community\n    *   New funding opportunities or significant shifts in existing funding priorities\n\n---\n\n### Discussion Questions (for staff/partners alignment):\n\n1.  What assumptions in this model feel most critical or\n    vulnerable, and what immediate steps can we take to test or address\n    them?\n2.  How can we further enhance the cultural relevance and accessibility of\n    our mobile market offerings and cooking circle curricula to ensure\n    maximum community benefit?\n3.  Given our small team and budget, what are our top priorities for\n    data collection that will genuinely inform our program adjustments\n    and demonstrate impact, without overburdening staff?\n4.  Beyond the stated indicators, what informal signs of success or\n    challenges should we be actively looking for on the ground in our\n    interactions with community members?\n5.  How do we ensure that participants not only gain skills but also feel\n    empowered to lead healthy changes in their own households and\n    communities, fostering long-term impact beyond the life of the\n    program?",

Yet these neighborhoods also hold deep culinary traditions, strong social networks, and resident-led organizing power. This program meets immediate need (affordable produce) while building longer-term community capacity (cooking skills, peer leadership, informal food-sharing). We reject deficit narratives: participants are not \"hard-to-reach\" but rather under-resourced by decades of disinvestment. Our equity approach centers their knowledge, compensates their time, and designs with\u2014not for\u2014residents.\n\n**How the Logic Model Guides Us:** This framework clarifies our if-then assumptions (e.g., *if* we accept SNAP and locate markets at trusted sites, *then* 520 households will shop regularly; *if* cooking circles build skills and relationships, *then* recipe-sharing networks emerge). Each column answers: What do we invest? What do we do? Who shows up? What changes in the short run? What shifts over time? What's our ultimate impact? Indicators are SMART and disaggregated (by race, ZIP, language) so we can track whether we're reaching those who need us most and adjust when we're not. Quarterly reviews and \"update triggers\" (e.g., <50% repeat rate, staffing turnover, SNAP policy shifts) prompt real-time course correction, not end-of-grant scrambling.\n\n**Key Assumptions:** (1) SNAP benefits remain stable and accepted by our vendors. (2) Residents have time/transportation to attend markets and circles. (3) Kitchen partners sustain access for 18 months. **Mitigation:** We monitor federal/state SNAP policy monthly, offer multiple market times, provide bus tokens, and cultivate backup kitchen sites now.\n\n**Top 3 Risks:** (1) Van breakdown disrupts market schedule \u2192 secure backup van rental agreement. (2) Low winter attendance \u2192 shift to indoor markets, hot meals. (3) Staffing turnover \u2192 cross-train team, document processes, offer competitive pay/benefits.\n\n---\n\n## LOGIC MODEL VS. THEORY OF CHANGE\n\nA **logic model** is a linear, tabular snapshot of program components and expected results at defined intervals. A **theory of change** is a broader narrative with visual pathways showing *why* and *how* change happens, including contextual factors, stakeholder relationships, and underlying assumptions about power and systems. This logic model feeds into\u2014but does not replace\u2014our fuller theory of change.\n\n---\n\n## TOP 3 ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS WITH MITIGATION\n\n### **Assumptions**\n1. **SNAP benefits stable:** Federal/state policy won't cut benefits or retailer eligibility during program period.  \n   *Mitigation:* Monitor legislative updates monthly; diversify payment options (cash, vouchers); join Illinois Food Security Coalition advocacy efforts.\n\n2. **Residents have capacity to participate:** Time, transportation, childcare, and physical/mental bandwidth exist.  \n   *Mitigation:* Offer flexible hours (weekday evenings, weekends); provide childcare and bus tokens; keep circles short (90 min); check in on barriers via surveys.\n\n3. **Kitchen access sustained:** Partner sites (churches, schools) maintain kitchen availability and liability coverage.  \n   *Mitigation:* Sign 18-month MOUs now; identify 2 backup sites per ZIP; budget $5K for rental kitchens if needed.\n\n### **Risks/External Factors**\n1. **Vehicle breakdown:** Refrigerated van essential; repairs could halt markets for weeks.  \n   *Mitigation:* Secure backup rental agreement with local food bank; set aside $3K emergency repair fund; schedule preventive maintenance quarterly.\n\n2. **Seasonal attendance drop:** Winter weather and shorter days may reduce turnout Nov\u2013Feb.  \n   *Mitigation:* Pilot indoor winter markets; offer hot soups/stews; bundle market with warming center services; send weekly text reminders.\n\n3. **Staff turnover:** Small team means loss of one person = 25\u201350% capacity hit.  \n   *Mitigation:* Competitive wages ($18\u2013$22/hr for CHWs); professional development funds; cross-training; clear documentation (SOPs, runbooks); hire from community to deepen roots.\n\n---\n\n## QUARTERLY REVIEW CADENCE & UPDATE TRIGGERS\n\n**Quarterly Review Process (Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18):**\n- Staff convene 2-hour data review: compare actuals vs. targets across all indicators.\n- Community advisory board (8 resident members) receives accessible 1-page dashboard, discusses what's working/not.\n- Document 1\u20133 adaptations per quarter (e.g., shift market time, add new recipe theme, adjust outreach zone).\n- Submit funder report within 2 weeks of quarter-end.\n\n**Update Triggers (Prompt Immediate Model Revision):**\n- **Performance:** Any indicator <60% of target for 2 consecutive months (e.g., repeat visit rate <36% vs. 60% target).\n- **Staffing:** Turnover of Program Manager or \u22652 team members within 3-month period.\n- **Policy:** SNAP policy change affecting eligibility, benefit levels, or retailer rules.\n- **Safety:** COVID resurgence, food safety incident, or community violence disrupting operations.\n- **Partnership:** Loss of kitchen access, farm supplier, or key referring organization.\n- **Budget:** Funding cut >10% or unexpected expense >$5K.\n\n---\n\n## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FOR STAFF/PARTNER ALIGNMENT\n\n1. **Who's missing?** When we picture our \"typical\" participant, whose face do we see\u2014and whose do we overlook? How do our outreach methods, market times, and circle topics reflect or exclude specific groups (e.g., Spanish-dominant households, seniors with mobility limits, fathers/male caregivers, undocumented families)?\n\n2. **If-then check:** Look at our logic model's arrows. Which link feels weakest or most hopeful? For example, do we truly believe that cooking circles lead to recipe-sharing networks\u2014or are we assuming that without evidence? What would make us more confident?\n\n3. **Dignity test:** Imagine you're a participant. Does our intake process, our language (flyers, surveys), our physical setup (market layout, circle seating) communicate respect and belonging\u2014or charity and surveillance? What's one thing we'd change tomorrow?\n\n4. **Data for whom?** Are we collecting data to prove our worth to funders, or to learn and improve for participants? When we share results at community data-back events, will residents see themselves and their priorities\u2014or just our outputs?\n\n5. **Sustainability beyond the grant:** If funding ended in month 19, what parts of this program could residents sustain themselves (e.g., informal recipe swaps, peer-led markets)? What infrastructure or relationships would we need to build now to make that possible?\n\n---\n\n**End of Logic Model Framework**\n\n---\n\n### QUALITY CHECKS COMPLETED\n\u2705 Concrete, measurable language (no \"raise awareness\" without baseline/target)  \n\u2705 Outputs vs. outcomes clearly distinguished  \n\u2705 SMART indicators with numeric targets, disaggregated by race/ZIP/language  \n\u2705 Feasible data collection for small team (intake forms, sign-in sheets, biannual surveys, phone interviews)  \n\u2705 Budget-appropriate ($180K\u2013$240K) and capacity-aware (4 FTE)  \n\u2705 Equity centered: bilingual, SNAP-friendly, compensation for participants, resident voice in design  \n\u2705 Assumptions/risks explicit with mitigation steps  \n\u2705 Quarterly review + update triggers for adaptive management  \n\u2705 Warm, nonprofit-focused tone; avoids deficit framing and unexplained jargon",

The neighborhoods of Englewood (60621) and Woodlawn (60637) have strong community assets yet limited healthy retail nearby. Our approach centers Black and Latine households using SNAP, caregivers with children under 12, and seniors by bringing the market to transit-accessible sites, accepting and maximizing SNAP/Link Match, and offering bilingual, hands-on cooking circles that reflect local foodways. If affordable, relevant foods are consistently available and families build practical cooking skills, then purchasing and meal routines shift; if those behaviors persist, households experience sustained food security and better nutrition.\n\nEquity shows up in who leads and who benefits. Community Ambassadors (paid residents) co-design routes, recipes, and outreach. All data are disaggregated by race/ethnicity, ZIP, and primary language, and decisions prioritize groups underrepresented in outcomes. The plan is right-sized for a 4-person team and $180\u2013$240k budget: 72 market days, 12 cooking cohorts, and low-burden data collection (POS exports, short pre/post forms, SMS micro-surveys). Quarterly CQI reviews guide adaptations\u2014adjusting hours, products, and locations; strengthening vendor mix; and tuning messaging.\n\nKey assumptions: steady site access, stable SNAP policy, and reliable local supply. Risks include weather disruptions, staffing turnover, and incentive funding gaps; we mitigate with indoor backup sites, cross-training and volunteer bench, and setting a capped match per visit with diversified funding. The logic model drives management: each activity has outputs, measurable outcomes, and a responsible role, with clear indicators to track progress and trigger course corrections.\n\nTop assumptions (3) and mitigation\n- Community trust enables participation; mitigation: ambassadors from each ZIP, presence at existing gatherings.\n- SNAP/Link Match rules remain favorable; mitigation: maintain policy watch, flexible pricing, diversify subsidy funds.\n- Vendor supply meets demand; mitigation: multiple MOUs, seasonal menus, backup wholesalers.\n\nTop risks/external factors (3) and mitigation\n- Severe weather/site closures; mitigation: indoor partners, text alerts, pop-up tents.\n- Staff turnover in a small team; mitigation: cross-train, SOPs, part-time relief pool.\n- Underperforming indicators; mitigation: monthly dashboards, PDSA within one quarter.\n\nReview cadence and update triggers\n- Quarterly reviews with ambassadors and partners; share a 1-page dashboard publicly.\n- Update triggers: staffing changes >25% FTE shift; SNAP/Link policy changes; two consecutive quarters below target on any key indicator; loss of a site/vendor; safety incidents.\n\nDiscussion questions for alignment\n- Which barriers to participation are we assuming our current hours and locations solve\u2014and for whom might they not?\n- Where can ambassadors exercise more decision-making power without slowing operations?\n- Which indicators most meaningfully reflect household dignity and choice, not just throughput?\n- What\u2019s our minimum viable market day (staff/time/inventory) if funding tightens?\n- How will we respond if disaggregated data show gaps by language or ZIP despite overall success?\n\nNote on logic model vs. theory of change\n- A logic model is a practical, one-page visual flow linking inputs to activities, outputs, and measurable outcomes with indicators. A theory of change is the broader causal narrative explaining why and under what conditions change should happen, including context and evidence beyond the program\u2019s direct control.",

      "content": "Prepared by Director of Programs, for Board, Date 2025-11-02\n\n## Appalachia Learning Network: Rural Digital Skills Pathways - Logic Model Framework\n\n**Narrative Summary:**\n\nThe Appalachia Learning Network (ALN) is launching Rural Digital Skills Pathways to empower adults aged 25-64 in Pike, Floyd, and Letcher Counties, Eastern Kentucky. We're focusing on individuals with limited digital literacy, underemployed jobseekers, and SNAP/TANF participants \u2013 folks who too often get left behind in a rapidly digitalizing world. Our program is rooted in a fundamental belief: accessible digital skills aren't just about jobs; they're about self-sufficiency, civic engagement, and unlocking new opportunities right here at home.\n\nThe rationale is clear: these communities face significant digital divides, impacting access to employment, education, healthcare, and vital government services. By providing practical, relevant digital training, we aim to bridge this gap, leading to improved economic stability and a more engaged citizenry. Our equity approach is central. We design our curriculum and delivery methods with the specific needs of our target population in mind, utilizing culturally relevant examples, offering flexible scheduling, providing transportation assistance (if needed), and ensuring a supportive learning environment free from judgment. We\u2019ll offer one-on-one coaching and small group settings to build confidence, and partner with local employers to ensure skills acquired directly translate to local job openings. We avoid deficit framing by recognizing the inherent strengths and experiences our participants bring, focusing instead on skill-building and opportunity creation.\n\nThis logic model is our roadmap for the next 24 months. It will guide our team of 10 in making resource allocation decisions (our budget of $900,000\u2013$1,100,000 for 24 months allows for dedicated staff, technology, and outreach), ensure our activities are directly linked to our desired outcomes, and provide the framework for robust evaluation. We'll use this model to track progress, learn what\u2019s working (and what isn\u2019t), and make data-driven adjustments during our quarterly reviews. For instance, if an indicator like \"successful certification completion\" is underperforming, we'll trigger a review of teaching methods or curriculum content.

(Mitigation: Provide mobile hotspots, partner with local libraries). <br>\u2022 Economic downturn affecting local job market. (Mitigation: Diversify advanced training to recession-proof skills, expand remote work options). <br>\u2022 Competing community priorities or lack of sustained participant engagement. (Mitigation: Emphasize participant voice, flexible scheduling, incentive small achievements). | **Curriculum Design:** Culturally relevant content, addresses local needs, includes modules on navigating government/health online services. **Accessibility:** Flexible scheduling (evenings/weekends), transportation support provision, ADA-compliant learning spaces. **Language & Pedagogy:** Avoids jargon, uses plain language, incorporates hands-on learning, small group sizes. **Outreach:** Targeted outreach to underrepresented groups (e.g., rural elderly, those without home internet) using trusted community voices. **Support:** One-on-one coaching, holistic support services referrals (e.g., childcare, mental health). |\n\n---\n\n**Top 3 Assumptions:**\n1.  **Participant Motivation & Persistence:** We assume individuals are motivated to improve their digital skills and are able to persist through a multi-week training program, despite potential personal barriers.\n2.  **Local Job Market Alignment:** We assume the core digital skills taught (e.g., Google Workspace, online communication) are relevant to existing or emerging job opportunities within Pike, Floyd, and Letcher Counties, and that employers are open to hiring ALN graduates.\n3.  **Basic Learning Capacity:** We assume participants possess the foundational learning abilities required to grasp new digital concepts, even those with limited prior formal education.\n\n**Top 3 Risks/External Factors & Mitigation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Limited Broadband Access/Affordability:**\n    *   **Risk:** Many residents in our target counties lack reliable and affordable home internet, limiting their ability to practice skills or apply for jobs learned in class.\n    *   **Mitigation:** Provide mobile hotspots for program duration to eligible participants; partner with local libraries and community centers for accessible practice labs; incorporate training on low-bandwidth solutions.\n2.  **Economic Downturn/Job Market Contraction:**\n    *   **Risk:** A sudden economic downturn could reduce available job opportunities, making it harder for participants to convert their new skills into employment.\n    *   **Mitigation:** Proactively engage with economic development agencies; diversify advanced skill tracks to include more remote-work-friendly or recession-resilient sectors (e.g., healthcare support, entrepreneurship basics); emphasize transferable skills useful across industries.\n3.  **Low Enrollment/Engagement from Target Population:**\n    *   **Risk:** Difficulty reaching and retaining the specific harder-to-reach populations (e.g., very low digital literacy, high-barrier SNAP/TANF participants) despite outreach efforts.\n    *   **Mitigation:** Leverage trusted community leaders and existing service providers (e.g., churches, food banks, social service agencies) as referral partners; offer flexible schedules and shorter modules; provide \"taster\" sessions to build initial interest; emphasize practical, immediate benefits (e.g., applying for benefits online, staying connected with family).\n\n---\n\n**Review Cadence & Update Triggers:**\n\n*   **Quarterly Review:** Program Manager, M&E Specialist, and Lead Digital Skills Coach will review all indicators, progress against targets, and current activities.\n*   **Update Triggers:**\n    *   When any short-term outcome indicator is >20% below target for two consecutive quarters.\n    *   Significant staffing shifts (e.g., loss of 2+ staff).\n    *   Major policy changes affecting SNAP/TANF benefits or workforce development funding.\n    *   When participant feedback consistently highlights a specific program barrier or need not currently addressed.\n    *   New local economic development initiatives or closures impacting local job market.\n\n---\n\n**Discussion Questions for Staff/Partners:**\n\n1.  \"If we successfully increase participants' digital literacy scores by 20%, what's one specific, tangible new online action we expect them to take in their daily lives or job search that isn't explicitly listed here?\" (Surfaces hidden assumptions about application of skills)\n2.  \"Given our budget and capacity, where do we foresee the greatest challenge in consistently collecting *reliable* data for our intermediate outcome indicators (e.g., income increase, employment status), and what creative, low-burden solutions can we brainstorm?\" (Aligns on measurement feasibility & identifies potential blind spots)\n3.  \"Thinking about the adults we want to serve in these specific counties, what\u2019s the *biggest non-digital* barrier they might face in accessing or completing this program, and how could our current plan better address it, even if it's not directly a 'digital skill'?\" (Explores external factors and deepens equity considerations)\n4.  \"We assume local employers align with our training. What if we find a disconnect? How quickly can we pivot our advanced training modules to be responsive to *actual* employer demand, and who needs to be involved in making those decisions?\" (Addresses risk mitigation and adaptability)\n5.  \"One of our long-term impacts is 'Empowered Citizens'. Beyond just using government websites, what does this truly look like in Eastern Kentucky, and what subtle cues or feedback should we be looking for from participants to know we're moving in that direction?\" (Clarifies impact definition & identifies qualitative data points)",

This pathway meets that moment: county-based outreach; clear assessments; short, stackable bootcamps; devices and connectivity; credentials mapped to local roles; and work-based learning that leads to real offers. Our equity approach centers convenience and dignity\u2014evening/weekend cohorts, childcare and gas supports, trauma-informed instruction, and disaggregated tracking by county, age, and education so we spot and close gaps fast. We prioritize SNAP/TANF participants and underemployed jobseekers, without deficit framing; we build on their experience and time constraints.\n\nAssumptions include steady employer demand for digital-involved roles, reachable participants for follow-up, and available internet options. Risks include subsidy changes (e.g., ACP), staff turnover, and transportation/childcare shortages. Mitigation: negotiate ISP discounts and maintain hotspot lending; cross-train staff and maintain an instructor bench; pre-budget wraparound supports and partner with local providers. The logic model guides daily operations (who does what, by when), management (monthly dashboards; quarterly reviews), and evaluation (pre/post assessments, credential and wage tracking via UI wage records and employer verification). With a 10-person team and a $900k\u2013$1.1M budget, data collection is \u201cmedium\u201d: we use existing systems (CRM, Northstar), short SMS surveys, and twice-yearly wage matches\u2014not burdensome studies. Quarterly reviews drive course corrections; update triggers include staffing shifts, policy changes, and underperforming indicators.\n\nTop assumptions (and mitigation)\n- Employer demand stays strong for entry/middle digital roles (maintain quarterly employer roundtables; adjust credential mix).\n- Participants can commit 6\u201310 hrs/week (offer multiple schedules; hybrid options).\n- Partners honor MOUs (set quarterly check-ins; shared dashboards).\n\nTop risks/external factors (and mitigation)\n- Broadband subsidy changes/ACP sunset (negotiate ISP discounts; expand hotspot pool; advocate via coalition).\n- Staff turnover or leave (cross-train; contractor bench; onboarding playbooks).\n- Transportation/childcare disruptions (reserve flexible funds; multiple cohort sites per county).\n\nReview cadence and update triggers\n- Quarterly learning reviews with partners; monthly internal huddles on dashboard trends.\n- Update triggers: staff changes >15% FTE; policy/funding shifts affecting tuition/devices/connectivity; any indicator falling below 80% of target for 2 consecutive months; employer hiring freeze in a priority sector.\n\nDiscussion questions\n- Do our credential choices match the real jobs and tools used by employers in each county?\n- Where are we seeing completion gaps by age or education level, and what\u2019s our near-term fix?\n- What wraparound supports had the biggest ROI on attendance\u2014should we rebalance funds?\n- Are our follow-up methods reaching alumni evenly across counties?\n- Which partnerships should become formal (MOUs/articulation) versus informal referrals?\n\nNote: A logic model is a concise, testable flow from inputs to outcomes with indicators for each step. A theory of change adds the broader causal narrative, context, and evidence base explaining why these links should hold in the real world.",

In Pike, Floyd, and Letcher Counties, limited broadband infrastructure, lower educational attainment, and economic transition from coal have compounded barriers. This 24-month initiative will serve 240 adults through an 8-week foundational curriculum, 1:1 career navigation, device/hotspot loans, and employer partnerships, ultimately aiming for 37.5% employment in living-wage jobs and 31% sustained employment with benefits.\n\n**Equity Approach:** We reject deficit framing. Participants bring rich community knowledge, resilience, and work ethic; our role is to remove structural barriers\u2014cost, scheduling, childcare, stigma\u2014and co-design learning that honors diverse starting points. We disaggregate data by age, county, gender, education, disability, race/ethnicity, and SNAP/TANF status to surface and address disparities. Courses are offered in English and Spanish, with ASL interpretation, 6th-grade reading materials, and no GED prerequisites. Childcare stipends, evening/weekend sessions, and a mobile lab expand access for caregivers and shift workers. Peer learning circles and paid ambassador roles elevate participant leadership.\n\n**Key Assumptions:**  \n1. SNAP/TANF offices and libraries will actively refer clients.  \n2. Broadband at hub sites remains reliable; ACP (Affordable Connectivity Program) stays funded.  \n3. Employers will interview/hire participants; local economy remains stable.\n\n**Mitigation Steps:**  \n1. Cultivate 6+ referral partners; hold monthly coordination meetings.  \n2. Secure hotspots; advocate for ACP extension; partner with ISPs for backup plans.  \n3. Diversify employer pool (10+ partners across sectors); offer free recruiting support.\n\nThe logic model guides implementation via quarterly reviews of indicators, monthly data dashboards, and \"update triggers\" (staffing turnover, policy shifts, <60% enrollment by Month 6, <40% completion rates). If-then logic ensures each step is testable: *If* we loan devices, *then* participants practice more; *if* they practice, *then* skills improve; *if* skills improve, *then* job applications succeed. External evaluation at Months 12 and 24 validates assumptions and informs course corrections, keeping the model practical for a small team managing real-world complexity.\n\n---\n\n## Logic Model vs. Theory of Change\n\n**Note:** This logic model is a linear, tabular framework showing inputs\u2192activities\u2192outputs\u2192outcomes with measurable indicators, designed for operational management and funder reporting. A theory of change would be a visual flow diagram mapping causal pathways, underlying beliefs, and contextual factors (e.g., \"poverty is structural,\" \"peer support drives persistence\") across the broader ecosystem\u2014useful for strategic visioning but less granular for day-to-day tracking.\n\n---\n\n## Top 3 Assumptions & Top 3 Risks/External Factors\n\n### **Assumptions**\n1. **Referral partnerships will yield steady enrollment:** SNAP/TANF offices, libraries, and churches will proactively refer eligible adults and trust our program.  \n   *Mitigation:* Monthly partner check-ins; co-brand materials; share success stories; offer partner staff mini-training on digital equity.\n\n2. **Participants can commit 6 hours/week for 8 weeks:** Despite caregiving, multiple jobs, and transportation challenges, adults will sustain attendance.  \n   *Mitigation:* Flexible scheduling (evenings, weekends); childcare stipends ($15/session); transport vouchers; hybrid (some virtual) options; makeup sessions.\n\n3. **Broadband and devices available via ACP, libraries, and loaners:** Connectivity won't be a showstopper for learning or job search.  \n   *Mitigation:* 90 loaner devices/hotspots; partnerships with ISPs for discounted plans; mobile lab for homebound learners; offline learning materials as backup.\n\n### **Risks/External Factors**\n1. **ACP federal funding sunset (potential 2026):** Loss of $30/month broadband subsidy could strand participants without home internet.  \n   *Mitigation:* Advocate for program extension; negotiate ISP discounts; budget reserve for emergency subsidies; prioritize library/hub access.\n\n2. **Economic downturn or employer hiring freeze:** Recession could reduce job openings, undermining employment outcomes despite skill gains.  \n   *Mitigation:* Diversify employer partners (healthcare, logistics, remote work less cyclical); pivot to self-employment/gig economy training; emphasize benefit access and civic engagement outcomes.\n\n3. **Staffing turnover (instructors, navigators):** Small nonprofit wages, rural isolation, and burnout may cause key staff to leave mid-cycle.  \n   *Mitigation:* Competitive pay (budget $52K avg); professional development stipends; peer support circles for staff; cross-train roles; document curricula for continuity.\n\n---\n\n## Quarterly Review Cadence & Update Triggers\n\n**Quarterly Review Process (Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24):**  \n- **Data Review:** Program Director and Data Coordinator present dashboard (enrollment, completion, employment, satisfaction by county/demographic).  \n- **Staff Debrief:** Instructors and Navigators share qualitative insights (what's working, participant feedback, emerging needs).  \n- **Indicator Check:** Compare actuals to targets; flag underperformance (e.g., <60% on any short-term outcome).  \n- **Action Items:** Adjust activities (e.g., add Saturday courses, partner with new employer, revise curriculum pacing) within 30 days.  \n- **Board Briefing:** Summary memo with 2\u20133 recommendations; full report biannually.\n\n**Update Triggers (When to Revise Logic Model Mid-Cycle):**  \n1. **Enrollment <60% of target by Month 6:** Reassess outreach strategy, eligibility criteria, or referral partnerships.  \n2. **Completion rate <50% by Month 9:** Investigate barriers (timing, childcare, content difficulty); pilot solutions.  \n3. **Employment outcomes <30% by Month 18:** Expand employer pool, enhance job readiness support, or add credential tracks.  \n4. **Staff turnover \u22653 key roles in 6 months:** Revisit compensation, workload, supervision model.  \n5. **Policy change (ACP termination, WIOA rule shift, state budget cut):** Convene emergency planning session; adjust budget/activities.  \n6. **Equity red flag:** Data show persistent disparity (e.g., no hires among SNAP participants, zero Latinx enrollment): Conduct equity audit, engage affected community, redesign outreach/support.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion Questions for Staff/Partner Alignment\n\nUse these at kickoff retreat, quarterly reviews, or when tensions surface:\n\n1. **Shared Vision:** *When we say \"digital literacy,\" what does success look like for a 45-year-old single mom in Letcher County who's never used email? What would she say changed in her life?*  \n   *(Surfaces hidden assumptions about outcomes; centers participant voice; checks if team agrees on \"success.\")*\n\n2. **Equity Trade-offs:** *If we can only afford childcare stipends OR weekend courses (not both), which better serves our most marginalized participants\u2014and how do we decide?*  \n   *(Tests commitment to equity vs. convenience; reveals decision-making values; invites cost-benefit thinking.)*\n\n3. **Theory of Change Assumptions:** *We assume employers will hire participants who complete training. What evidence do we have? What if they don't\u2014does the program still have value?*  \n   *(Challenges employment-centric bias; opens space for broader outcomes like civic engagement, health access, family support.)*\n\n4. **Data and Privacy:** *Participants may fear sharing income data or immigration status (even if eligible for services). How do we build trust, and what do we do if 40% refuse to provide follow-up data?*  \n   *(Addresses real barriers to evaluation; prompts discussion of consent, anonymization, alternative metrics, and cultural humility.)*\n\n5. **Sustainability and Scale:** *If this works, how do we sustain it after grant funding ends\u2014and should we? Or is our role to prove the model and advocate for public investment?*  \n   *(Clarifies organizational mission\u2014service delivery vs. systems change; informs Year 2 fundraising and policy strategy.)*\n\n---\n\n**End of Document**  \n*For questions or revisions, contact Director of Programs.

This initiative is designed to enhance physical and financial resilience against increasingly severe weather events exacerbated by climate change. Our approach is deeply rooted in equity, recognizing that systemic inequities have historically limited access to flood mitigation resources for these vulnerable populations. We employ a proactive, community-centered outreach strategy, utilizing trusted community partners and multilingual materials to ensure no one is left behind. Outreach will specifically target high-risk zip codes with high concentrations of LMI households, older adults, and individuals with disabilities, ensuring culturally and linguistically appropriate engagement. Retrofit solutions will prioritize affordability, accessibility, and resident choice, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. For example, retrofits for older adults might include ADA-compliant ramps alongside flood vents. Data collection will disaggregate by race/ethnicity, zip code, and disability status to continuously monitor equity of access and impact, allowing for adaptive management to address any emergent disparities. Our goal is not merely to \"raise awareness,\" but to equip residents with tangible, accessible, and sustainable solutions that genuinely reduce their vulnerability and improve their quality of life. This logic model will guide implementation by providing clear targets and indicators for each stage, facilitating continuous monitoring and evaluation, and enabling adaptive management to ensure the program remains effective, equitable, and accountable to its beneficiaries and funders. It will serve as the backbone for assessing progress, identifying challenges, and demonstrating impact.\n\n**Distinguishing Logic Model from Theory of Change:**\nThis Logic Model presents a structured, tabular representation of a linear causal pathway from inputs to long-term outcomes for specific programmatic activities. A Theory of Change, while encompassing similar causal links, typically offers a broader, more narrative explanation of the overall impact pathway, stakeholders, and underlying assumptions, often visually depicted with more complex feedback loops and contextual factors.\n\n---\n\n### Gulf Coast Resilience Coalition: Resilient Homes Retrofit Initiative \u2013 Logic Model Framework\n\n| Inputs | Activities | Outputs | Short-term Outcomes (6\u201312 mo) | Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 yrs) | Long-term Outcomes/Impact (3+ yrs) | Indicators & Targets | Data Sources & Frequency | Responsible Role | Assumptions/External Factors | Equity Considerations |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Staff:** 35 FTE (Project Managers, Community Outreach, Engineers, Case Managers, Admin Support) | **1.

Update triggers include:\n*   Significant staffing shifts (e.g., 20%+ change in FTE).\n*   Major policy changes affecting flood resilience or LMI housing.\n*   Underperforming indicators (e.g., target achievement below 70% for two consecutive quarters).\n*   Major unforeseen external shocks (e.g., catastrophic flood event).\n*   Major budget allocation changes (\u00b115%).\n\n**Discussion Questions for Staff/Partners:**\n1.  What assumptions in this model feel most critical or potentially shaky from your perspective, and what evidence do we have to support or challenge them?\n2.  Are there any populations or specific needs within the LMI, older adult, or disability communities that you feel are not adequately addressed by our current activities or equity considerations?\n3.  How can we best leverage our community partners to strengthen our outreach and ensure we are genuinely reaching the most vulnerable individuals who stand to benefit most from this initiative?\n4.  Beyond the metrics, what qualitative stories or experiences do we need to capture to fully articulate the impact of this program on residents' lives?",

Grounded in local data, the program prioritizes older adults and people with disabilities living in repeatedly flooded ZIP codes, ensuring language access and accessibility. A dedicated workforce pathway grows diverse local contractor capacity to deliver high-quality, code-compliant retrofits, while policy engagement streamlines permits and aligns incentives. The Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) system enables timely decisions with geocoded, disaggregated data and quarterly reviews.\n\nThe program\u2019s equity approach centers choice, affordability, and non-displacement. Owner retrofits are cost-free to LMI households; rental grants require right-to-return and 5-year affordability. Case management funds accessibility modifications and temporary accommodations. All indicators are disaggregated by race/ethnicity, ZIP code, and disability status and co-governed with a community advisory group. Data collection methods follow high-quality, inclusive, harmonized (HIGH) standards: CRM-based case tracking, mobile QA checklists, HAZUS/GIS modeling, structured surveys with accessible formats, insurance document verification, and event-triggered after-action reviews. A 35-person team and an $8\u201312M budget focus on feasible volume\u20141,000 assessments, 700 retrofits (500 owner, 200 rental)\u2014with strong QA and partnerships to manage risk and scale.\n\nKey assumptions include sustained permitting pathways, availability of skilled labor and materials, and stable NFIP/ICC incentives. Risks include major policy or market shifts, severe event access constraints, and landlord participation variability. Mitigation includes MOUs with jurisdictions and VOADs, diversified contracting pools, contingency procurement, and binding tenant protections. The logic model guides implementation by linking resources to measurable changes, aligning roles and timelines, and setting SMART targets for continuous improvement and credible impact evaluation.\n\nHow this logic model differs from a theory of change\n- A logic model is a visual, testable flow from inputs to outcomes with specific outputs and indicators; it guides day-to-day management and measurement.\n- A theory of change narrates broader causal pathways and context, including why strategies should work, often with preconditions and feedback loops beyond the project scope.\n\nTop assumptions (with mitigation)\n- Permits/codes allow target retrofits: Mitigate via early policy engagement and pre-approved detail sheets.\n- Sufficient contractor capacity: Mitigate via workforce pipeline and multi-year task-order contracts.\n- NFIP credits remain available: Mitigate via diversified counseling on private/fair plans and documentation for mitigation discounts.\n\nTop risks/external factors (with mitigation)\n- Extreme storms disrupt access: Preposition supplies; post-event MOUs for debris/access; flexible scheduling.\n- Supply chain price spikes: Bulk purchase agreements; escalation clauses; alternate approved materials.\n- Landlord opt-out risk: Incentive design with higher grants for deeper affordability; enforceable covenants; tenant choice.\n\nReview cadence and update triggers\n- Quarterly performance and equity reviews; annual external data audit.\n- Triggers: Underperforming indicators for two consecutive quarters; staff turnover >15%; major policy/code change; significant cost variance (>10%); declared disaster or supply chain disruption.\n\nDiscussion questions for alignment\n- Which ZIP codes and populations should be prioritized first, and why?\n- Where are we most likely to face permitting or landlord barriers, and what pre-work is required?\n- What is our minimum quality standard per retrofit type, and how will we enforce it equitably?\n- Which indicators best signal displacement risk early, and how will we respond?\n- How will community advisors shape mid-course corrections?",

The Resilient Homes Retrofit Initiative addresses these intersecting inequities through a comprehensive approach: subsidizing structural retrofits for 900 homes, building local resilience workforce capacity through training 400 residents, and advancing policy change to institutionalize equitable flood protection.\n\nOur equity approach rejects deficit narratives, instead recognizing that flood vulnerability results from systemic failures\u2014redlining, exclusionary zoning, inadequate public investment\u2014not individual shortcomings. We center community leadership through resident advisors who shape program design, prioritize accessibility (linguistic, physical, digital), and embed protections against displacement (renter lease guarantees, preference points for marginalized groups). Disaggregated data collection by race, disability status, and geography ensures we track whether benefits reach those most impacted and course-correct when disparities emerge.\n\n**Key assumptions:** (1) Households will prioritize flood resilience despite competing crises if we reduce barriers (cost, complexity, time); (2) Landlords will participate with sufficient incentives and tenant protections; (3) Quality workforce training creates pathways to stable employment even for residents facing employment discrimination. **Top risks:** (1) Major flood overwhelms capacity\u2014mitigated via waitlist protocols and surge volunteer activation; (2) Material cost inflation exceeds budget\u2014mitigated via bulk purchasing and contingency reserve; (3) Political shifts undermine policy advocacy\u2014mitigated via bipartisan framing and career staff relationships.\n\nThis logic model guides implementation through quarterly reviews assessing if-then linkages (e.g., *if* 70% gain knowledge, *then* 40% should apply for retrofits; if lower, investigate barriers). Update triggers include: <30% application conversion, staff turnover >20%, policy windows opening, funding shifts, or underperformance on equity indicators (e.g., <35% participation from redlined areas). The model prioritizes feasible data collection\u2014leveraging existing databases, brief surveys, administrative records\u2014appropriate for a 35-person team managing rigorous evaluation within operational realities.\n\n---\n\n## LOGIC MODEL VS. THEORY OF CHANGE\n\nThis **logic model** presents a linear, tabular display of programmatic inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes with specific indicators and targets, emphasizing measurable program management and accountability. A **theory of change** would provide a broader visual narrative mapping causal pathways, underlying assumptions, contextual preconditions, and spheres of influence/control, often including multiple strategies and external actors beyond direct program control, designed to articulate *why* and *how* change happens rather than *what* the program delivers.\n\n---\n\n## TOP ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS, AND MITIGATION\n\n### **Top 3 Assumptions**\n1. **Household Prioritization:** Low-income households will engage with flood resilience retrofitting despite competing urgent needs (rent, food, healthcare) *if* we eliminate cost barriers, simplify processes, and provide wraparound case management.\n   - **Test:** Track application rates among assessed households; if <35%, conduct barrier analysis interviews.\n\n2. **Landlord Participation:** Property owners will retrofit renter-occupied units *if* subsidies cover 100% of costs and lease protections prevent retaliatory rent increases or evictions.\n   - **Test:** Monitor landlord participation rates; target 35% of retrofits in renter units; if <25% by Year 2, adjust incentives or shift to whole-building strategies.\n\n3. **Workforce Absorption:** Local contractors and employers will hire training graduates despite limited prior experience *if* certifications validate skills and program provides hiring support.\n   - **Test:** Track 6-month employment rates; if <60%, intensify employer engagement and consider transitional employment partnerships.\n\n### **Top 3 External Risks & Mitigation**\n1. **Major Flood Event Overwhelms Demand:** Hurricane or severe flooding creates surge of 5,000+ requests beyond capacity.\n   - **Mitigation:** Maintain prioritized waitlist with transparent criteria; activate volunteer \"resilience brigades\" for rapid minor repairs; secure pre-approved bridge funding ($500K line of credit); coordinate with County Emergency Operations Center for resource sharing.\n\n2. **Supply Chain Disruption / Cost Inflation:** Material costs increase >30%, reducing number of affordable retrofits.\n   - **Mitigation:** Establish bulk purchasing agreements with three regional suppliers; build 5% cost contingency into retrofit budget ($400K); allow flexible material specifications (equivalent performance standards); phase installations to capitalize on price fluctuations.\n\n3. **Political Opposition / Policy Gridlock:** County/municipal leadership changes result in opposition to building code revisions or subsidy programs.\n   - **Mitigation:** Cultivate bipartisan champions (frame as fiscal responsibility and job creation, not just climate/equity); build relationships with career staff in planning/emergency management who persist across administrations; document cost-benefit analyses showing public savings; maintain diverse coalition including business and insurance industry allies.\n\n---\n\n## QUARTERLY REVIEW CADENCE & UPDATE TRIGGERS\n\n**Quarterly Review Process:**\n- **Participants:** Full staff (35), Board Resilience Committee (5 members), 3 community advisors, 2 funder representatives (optional).\n- **Agenda:** (1) Review output and outcome data against targets; (2) Analyze equity indicators for disparities; (3) Assess assumptions (are if-then links holding?); (4) Identify implementation challenges and adaptations; (5) Update risk register; (6) Adjust work plans for next quarter.\n- **Deliverable:** 5-page dashboard with stoplight indicators (green/yellow/red) and narrative explaining variances, shared with all stakeholders within 2 weeks.\n\n**Update Triggers (Immediate Logic Model Revision Required):**\n1. **Underperformance on Equity Indicators:** <35% participation from historically redlined neighborhoods, <20% participation from people with disabilities, or significant disparities in satisfaction/outcomes by race/ethnicity for two consecutive quarters.\n2. **Staffing Changes:** Turnover >20% in single quarter, loss of key leadership (Executive Director, M&E Director, Policy Director), or funding reduction requiring >15% staff cuts.\n3. **Policy Windows or Shifts:** Unexpected policy opportunity (e.g., state/federal funding becomes available, county leadership change creates opening) or adverse policy change (e.g., budget cuts to emergency management, restrictions on subsidy programs).\n4. **Major External Event:** Hurricane, severe flooding, or other disaster significantly alters context, demand, or capacity.\n5. **Significant Variance from Logic:** Application rate <25% of assessments, job placement rate <50%, or retrofit completion <120/year for two consecutive quarters, indicating broken if-then assumptions requiring theory revision.\n\n---\n\n## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS TO ALIGN STAFF/PARTNERS\n\n1. **Equity Trade-offs:** If we face a waitlist, how do we balance depth (fewer households receiving comprehensive retrofits + case management) versus breadth (more households receiving basic retrofits)? What criteria should prioritize households beyond first-come-first-served, and how do we make rationing decisions transparent and equitable without reinforcing deficit narratives or creating burdensome \"deservingness\" requirements?\n\n2. **Renter Participation Barriers:** Our assumption is landlords will participate with full subsidies and lease protections.
