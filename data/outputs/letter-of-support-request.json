SSYAC brings professional teaching artists into trusted community spaces\u2014libraries, parks, community centers\u2014to deliver visual arts, music production, and creative writing workshops twice weekly for 30 weeks annually. Youth create portfolios, showcase work publicly, and build relationships with mentors who reflect their identities. Serving 120 students annually in Bronzeville, Greater Grand Crossing, and Washington Park, the program centers Black and Latinx youth, removes cost and transportation barriers, and partners with neighborhood anchors to ensure cultural relevance and long-term sustainability.

Responding to limited after-school arts access, safety concerns between 3\u20136 pm, and cost/transportation barriers, SSYAC will co-locate labs at the Bronzeville Branch, a trusted, ADA-accessible community hub. Teaching artists from the South Side will lead weekly labs, culminating in family showcases and library-based exhibitions.

The program prioritizes equity by offering culturally responsive services for Native American veterans, eliminating transportation barriers through telehealth, and training community health workers from the populations served. Expected outcomes include 300+ veterans served annually, reduced emergency department utilization, and sustainable infrastructure for ongoing behavioral health access across three counties.\n\n---\n\n## TALKING POINTS FOR PRAIRIE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER LETTER\n\n**Include 5\u20137 of these points with specific details:**\n\n1. **Partner Role & Credibility**  \n   Prairie Regional Medical Center serves as the primary acute care hospital for northern Oklahoma, with emergency and inpatient services that frequently encounter veterans in behavioral health crisis.

CCRN\u2019s Community Flood Mitigation Hubs will deliver neighborhood-based services: risk screenings, referrals for home retrofits and drainage fixes, preparedness education, connection to assistance, and rapid resource distribution during flood events. Working with Sea Island Community Land Trust and other trusted partners, we\u2019ll site and staff hubs where people already gather, reduce barriers to access, and prioritize residents least served by current systems.

Your partnership has been central to our flood preparedness work, and a letter from Sea Island Community Land Trust would strengthen our application significantly.\n\nWe've attached talking points, letter specifications, and a draft template you can customize. We're happy to draft the full letter for your review and edits if that's easier\u2014just let us know.\n\nCould you confirm receipt and your availability to provide this letter by [DEADLINE]?

Flooding events disproportionately impact residents with limited financial resources, inadequate infrastructure, and barriers to accessing municipal services. Our approach combines community-led planning, multilingual outreach, pre-positioned supplies, backup water systems, and partnerships with trusted local organizations like Sea Island Community Land Trust. This project will serve approximately 8,500 residents annually, prioritizing communities of color, renters, and households earning below 80% area median income who face the greatest climate vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## TALKING POINTS FOR LETTER\n\n**Please incorporate 5-7 of these points in your letter:**\n\n1. **Credibility & Role:** Sea Island Community Land Trust has secured permanent affordable housing for 127 families in flood-prone coastal areas and provides direct services to residents in Charleston and Berkeley Counties, giving us deep knowledge of community flood vulnerabilities and trusted relationships with the populations this project will serve.\n\n2. **Current Collaboration:** We currently partner with CCRN through quarterly community preparedness workshops, referrals to flood mitigation resources, and shared outreach to Spanish-speaking residents in North Charleston and Edisto Island communities.\n\n3. **Concrete Commitment \u2013 Space:** Sea Island Community Land Trust will provide meeting space at our North Charleston office for monthly Hub coordination meetings (12 meetings/year, approximately 18 hours annually) and allow CCRN to co-locate emergency supplies at two of our properties during hurricane season (June\u2013November).\n\n4. **Concrete Commitment \u2013 Referrals & Outreach:** We will refer an estimated 40-60 households annually to the Hubs for flood preparedness assessments and emergency well water access, and will include Hub information in our quarterly resident newsletters (circulation: 340 households).\n\n5. **Concrete Commitment \u2013 Data Sharing:** We will share anonymized flood impact data from our residents (with consent) to inform Hub service design and will participate in CCRN's biannual community feedback sessions to assess program effectiveness.\n\n6. **Anticipated Community Benefit:** This project will provide our residents\u2014many of whom are cost-burdened renters and families of color with limited emergency savings\u2014with accessible flood preparedness training, emergency water supplies during service disruptions, and culturally responsive recovery support, reducing displacement risk and health impacts from flooding events.\n\n7. **Alignment with Wells Fargo Resilient Communities Goals:** This project directly advances climate resilience for low-to-moderate income communities, builds community capacity through locally rooted partnerships, and addresses systemic inequities in disaster preparedness infrastructure that leave vulnerable populations underserved.\n\n8. **Evaluation & Feedback:** Sea Island Community Land Trust will participate in CCRN's quarterly partner feedback sessions and annual outcome evaluation surveys to track service reach, resident satisfaction, and areas for program improvement.\n\n9. **Sustainability:** Our partnership extends beyond this grant period\u2014we've committed to maintaining referral pathways and collaborative planning regardless of funding cycles, and will explore joint fundraising for long-term Hub sustainability after the Wells Fargo grant period ends.\n\n---\n\n## LETTER REQUIREMENTS\n\n- **Length:** 1 page (250-350 words)\n- **Format:** On Sea Island Community Land Trust letterhead\n- **Signatory:** Marisol Ortega, Executive Director, Sea Island Community Land Trust\n- **Submission:** PDF via email to resilience@ccrn.org by **[DEADLINE DATE, TIME, TIME ZONE]**\n- **Must Include:** \n  - Grant name: Wells Fargo Resilient Communities Grant 2026\n  - Applicant organization: Carolina Coastal Resilience Network (CCRN)\n  - Specific commitments (space, referrals, hours, or other quantified support)\n  - Signature (digital or scanned)\n\n---\n\n## DRAFT LETTER TEMPLATE\n\n**[Customize fields in brackets; delete optional sections if not needed]**\n\n---\n\n**[DATE]**\n\nWells Fargo Foundation  \nResilient Communities Grant Review Committee\n\n**Re: Letter of Support for Carolina Coastal Resilience Network \u2013 Wells Fargo Resilient Communities Grant 2026**\n\nDear Selection Committee,\n\nSea Island Community Land Trust strongly supports **[ORGANIZATION NAME]**'s application to the **[FUNDING OPPORTUNITY]** for **[PROGRAM NAME]** in **[GEOGRAPHY]**.\n\n**[PARTNER ROLE]:** As a community land trust serving Charleston and Berkeley Counties, we provide affordable housing and direct services to 127 families in flood-vulnerable coastal areas.
