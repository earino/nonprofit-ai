There's absolutely no pressure, but if you're curious about what we're up to, here are a few ways to reconnect:\n\n*   **Make a gift** to help us continue our work.\n*   **Volunteer as a studio helper** \u2013 no art experience needed, just a passion for supporting young people!\n*   **Join us at our next First Friday Open Studio** to see our students' incredible art firsthand.\n*   **Take a quick 2-minute feedback survey** to share your thoughts.\n*   Or simply **reply to this email** and say hello \u2013 we'd genuinely love to hear from you.\n\nHowever you choose to re-engage, we appreciate you and everything you've done for our students.\n\nWarmly,\n\nMarisol Vega\nExecutive Director\nSouth Side Youth Arts Collective",

We've truly missed your consistent support and the incredible difference it made in fighting hunger in our community.\n\nSince you last gave, we've seen an even greater need, but also amazing progress thanks to allies like you. For example, your past generosity helped us launch our new \"Fresh Food Access Initiative,\" bringing nutritious produce directly to underserved neighborhoods, something we know our Plate Partners truly value.\n\nWe'd absolutely love to have you back in whatever capacity feels right. If you're open to it, would you consider restarting your monthly gift, maybe signing up for a volunteer shift at the warehouse, attending a quick 30-minute facility tour to see us in action, or even just taking a 1-minute survey to share your thoughts? Even if you just want to stay in touch, we'd love that too!\n\nNo pressure at all, but we\u2019d genuinely love to hear from you. Just hit reply to this email!\n\nWarmly,\n\nAisha Rahman\nChief Development Officer\nGreater Capital Area Food Bank",
