However, it contains a significant structural flaw: the breakdown of impact uses incremental amounts ($50, $100, $250, $500) that don't add up to the donor's $1,000 gift, creating confusion about what their specific contribution accomplished. This mathematical inconsistency undermines the impact messaging.",

          "The impact section would be stronger if it said 'Your $1,000 provides...' with items that equal or approximate $1,000, or simply described the collective impact without dollar breakdowns",
          "Missing personalization placeholder is noted but '[Donor Name]' should ideally be flagged more clearly as a merge field",
