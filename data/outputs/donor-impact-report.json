We put it straight to work, exactly as you wanted \u2013 on youth workshop supplies and helmet safety. Your support, combined with your volunteering at the Spring Fix-a-Thon and attending our open house, means the world to us.\n\nThanks to you, our Earn-a-Bike Youth Workshops really took off this spring! Your $5,000 funded 43 complete packages for kids in our workshops. Each package, costing $115, included a workshop seat and a brand-new helmet and lock kit. That\u2019s a huge chunk of the 58 total packages we delivered! This spring, from March 1st to June 30th, we served 58 youth (ages 12-17) right here on Milwaukee\u2019s South Side, up from 42 last year! Over 12 workshops, each 2.5 hours long, every single kid not only learned skills but also rode away with a refurbished bike, a U-lock, and a helmet. We even gave them safety toolkits!\n\nWe checked in with the kids after 60 days, and the results are pretty neat. Before the program, only 43% of them rode their bikes 3 or more days a week, but now, a fantastic 78% are! And when it came to doing an ABC safety check (Air, Brakes, Chain), 92% could do it perfectly, compared to just 55% before. (We tracked all this using attendance logs, inventory, safety quizzes, and follow-up calls.)\n\nHere's an example: \"M.,\" who is 13, joined us feeling a bit nervous about fixing a flat tire. But by the third session, M. was teaching two other kids how to patch a tube and confidently checking brake pads with our checklist! M.\u2019s parent even told us that weekend bike rides have become their family's favorite way to get to the park without having to take the bus. We're so glad we can share these stories, with their parents' permission, of course!\n\nOur Earn-a-Bike program has been buzzing! We hit our goal of serving more youth this quarter, and the workshops have been super popular. One challenge we faced was getting enough refurbished bikes ready for all the new participants, but our team and volunteers (like you, Jordan!) pulled together to get them all spruced up. Our next big milestone is planning for our October 2025 Fall workshops!\n\nNo photo available.\n\nWe are so incredibly grateful for your partnership, Jordan. Your specific support for youth workshop supplies and helmet safety made a real and immediate difference in the lives of many young people.\n\nWe'll share your next update in our quarterly report.\n\nBest,\n\nAna Ruiz and Devon Cole\nShop Manager; Development Coordinator\nana@southsidecycle.org, devon@southsidecycle.org\n414-555-0139",

The challenge? We ran low on youth-sized helmets in April. Thanks to your restricted funds and quick reordering, we didn't turn anyone away. Next milestone: our October volunteer training to prep for fall sessions.\n\nJordan, seeing you at the Spring Fix-a-Thon on April 6 and our open house on March 15 meant a lot to our team.

This vital contribution has significantly bolstered our Frontier Mother & Baby Mobile Clinic, directly impacting maternal health services in Clay, Morton, and Hale counties. Your commitment to our mission, evidenced by our proposal review call in December 2024 and your site visit during a Morton County clinic on April 18, 2025, is deeply appreciated.\n\n**Outcomes Attributable to Your $25,000 Gift**\n\nYour $25,000 gift directly funded 20 clinic days for the Frontier Mother & Baby Mobile Clinic between January 1 and June 30, 2025. Given our per-unit cost of $1,250 per clinic day (covering staffing, fuel, and supplies), your support was indispensable in providing essential care.\n\nDuring this period, we proudly achieved the following:\n\n*   **Clients Served:** 312 prenatal visits were conducted, impacting 214 unduplicated clients across Clay, Morton, and Hale counties.\n*   **Outputs:** Your funding directly supported 20 clinic days, enabling 185 ultrasounds, 228 blood pressure screenings, 64 gestational diabetes screenings, and the distribution of 204 prenatal vitamin kits.\n*   **Outcomes:** We observed significant improvements: 72% of high-risk referrals completed specialty care within 30 days (up from a 51% baseline in 2024), and 88% of clients initiated prenatal vitamins within their first visit (an increase from 60% baseline in 2024).\n\nThese metrics are drawn from Athenahealth EHR visit summaries (Jan\u2013Jun 2025), our referral tracking spreadsheet, and client SMS satisfaction surveys (May 2025).\n\n**A Story of Impact**\n\nR., a 29-year-old seasonal farmworker in Hale County, had not received prenatal care since learning of her pregnancy. She visited our mobile clinic at a church parking lot, where an ultrasound revealed a high blood pressure alert. Our nurse immediately scheduled an OB appointment for R. the same week in the nearest town and arranged for gas vouchers. R. later texted that she had begun medication and felt \"relieved someone caught it.\" (Client provided verbal consent for anonymized narrative; no photo consent.)\n\n**Program Update**\n\nThe Frontier Mother & Baby Mobile Clinic continues to be a lifeline for expectant mothers in remote areas. A key milestone has been the successful integration of tele-consultation services for specialists, reducing the need for extensive travel for some referrals. We occasionally encounter challenges with internet connectivity in extremely rural locations, which we address by utilizing satellite hotspots to maintain consistent service. Our next significant milestone involves expanding our educational offerings to include newborn care workshops, beginning in November 2025.\n\n**What\u2019s Next**\n\nWe will continue to operate our mobile clinic, ensuring vital maternal health services reach underserved communities. We are particularly focused on strengthening our partnerships with local community centers to increase awareness and accessibility.\n\n[Suggestion: Mobile clinic parked beside a grain elevator; nurse greeting a client at the door (no faces).

Your support made prenatal care accessible in Clay, Morton, and Hale counties\u2014three of the most underserved regions in our service area.\n\n## What Your Gift Accomplished\n\nAt $1,250 per clinic day\u2014covering nursing staff, fuel, medical supplies, and ultrasound equipment\u2014your $25,000 funded 20 full clinic days between January and June 2025. Those 20 days generated:\n\n- **312 prenatal visits** serving 214 unduplicated clients across six counties  \n- **185 ultrasounds** (many were first-time imaging for clients)  \n- **228 blood pressure screenings**  \n- **64 gestational diabetes screenings**  \n- **204 prenatal vitamin kits** distributed at no cost  \n\nOutcomes improved significantly over our 2024 baseline. Among clients flagged as high-risk, 72% completed specialty care within 30 days\u2014up from 51% the previous year. Additionally, 88% of clients began prenatal vitamins during their first visit, compared to 60% in 2024. These figures come from our Athenahealth EHR visit summaries, referral tracking spreadsheet, and a May 2025 client SMS satisfaction survey.\n\n## A Client's Story\n\n\"R.,\" a 29-year-old seasonal farmworker in Hale County, had not seen a provider since learning she was pregnant. She visited our mobile clinic in a church parking lot, where she received an ultrasound and learned her blood pressure was dangerously high. Our nurse scheduled a same-week obstetrics appointment in the nearest town and arranged gas vouchers for transportation. R. texted later that she had been started on medication and felt \"relieved someone caught it.\" (Client provided verbal consent for this anonymized narrative.)\n\n## Program Update\n\nThe Henderson Family Foundation clinic days you funded launched on schedule in January. During your April 18 site visit to our Morton County stop, you saw firsthand how scheduling remains our largest challenge\u2014cell service gaps make appointment reminders difficult. We responded by partnering with local churches and WIC offices to post clinic schedules on paper flyers. Our next milestone is expanding to two additional counties in November 2025, pending new funding.\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe will send your next quarterly impact update in October 2025, covering July\u2013September outcomes. Thank you again for making maternal health a priority in rural communities that are often overlooked.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\n**Dr. Lila Ahmed**  \nDirector of Clinical Services  \nlila.ahmed@prairiehealth.org | 785-555-0462\n\n**Marco Nguyen**  \nDirector of Development  \nmarco.nguyen@prairiehealth.org\n\n---\n\n**Photo Suggestion:** Mobile clinic parked beside a grain elevator; nurse greeting a client at the door (no faces).  \n**Caption:** \"Your funding brought 20 days of prenatal care to remote towns.\"  \n**Alt text:** \"White medical van labeled 'Mobile Clinic' with a nurse welcoming a patient in a rural parking lot.\"",

We are so grateful for your generous unrestricted gift of $250,000 received on December 15, 2024. Your commitment to literacy and STEM pathways, along with your corporate social responsibility priorities, truly made a significant difference for the young people in our community. We also fondly remember your team\u2019s engagement during employee volunteer days in October 2024 and February 2025, and your CEO\u2019s insightful remarks at our Spring Breakfast in May.\n\n**Outcomes from Your Support**\n\nYour pivotal gift, as part of our pooled funding for the City Scholars Tutoring Expansion (2024\u201325) program budget of $3.1 million, helped us achieve remarkable results for Boston Public Schools students. Your unrestricted $250,000, representing 8% of the program budget, directly supported the growth and success of this vital initiative.\n\nSpecifically, your contribution helped us train 316 dedicated volunteer tutors at a cost of approximately $600 per trainee. These trained tutors are the heart of our program, and without your support, this level of expansion wouldn't have been possible. In addition, your funding strengthened our data systems and school partnerships, making it possible for us to expand our reach to 38 schools across Boston.\n\nFrom September 1, 2024, to June 15, 2025, we served **2,486 students** in grades 3\u20138 across these 38 Boston Public Schools. Our 316 volunteer tutors delivered an impressive **24,900 tutoring sessions**, each lasting 45 minutes.\n\nThe impact on student learning is clear. Students participating in our program showed an average reading growth of **+0.6 grade levels** from fall to spring, as measured by MAP Reading scores. This is a significant improvement compared to the district average of +0.4 grade levels. Even more encouraging, **68% of our participating students met or exceeded their growth targets**, a notable increase from 52% in the 2023\u201324 school year.

After two weekly sessions for six months, he now reads aloud at home and even picked his first chapter book on his own!

One challenge we faced was recruiting enough volunteers to meet the high demand from schools, but by strengthening our community outreach and leveraging partnerships, we successfully onboarded the necessary tutors. The next major milestone for this program is the launch of our 2025\u201326 academic year program in September 2025, where we aim to build on this year's successes.\n\n**What\u2019s Next**\n\nWe are excited about the preparations for the upcoming school year and the continued positive impact we can have.\n\n[Suggestion: Tutor and student reading side-by-side at a school library table (faces consented).

      "content": "# Your Partnership Fueled Record Reading Growth Across Boston\n\nDear Friends at BrightWave Technologies,\n\nThank you for your unrestricted gift of $250,000 on December 15, 2024. Your trust and flexibility made all the difference this school year.\n\n## What Your Gift Accomplished\n\nYour $250,000 represented 8% of our $3.1 million City Scholars Tutoring Expansion program budget for 2024\u201325 (September 1, 2024\u2013June 15, 2025). Pooled with other unrestricted funding, your contribution helped train 316 volunteer tutors\u2014roughly $600 per trainee\u2014and supported the data systems and school partnerships that enabled us to expand from 22 to 38 Boston Public Schools this year.\n\nHere's what happened: **2,486 students in grades 3\u20138 received consistent reading support.** Our trained tutors delivered 24,900 one-on-one sessions (45 minutes each) throughout the school year. Students averaged **+0.6 grade levels of reading growth** from fall to spring on MAP Reading assessments, compared to +0.4 for the district overall. Even more encouraging, **68% of participating students met or exceeded their growth targets**, up from 52% last year (source: Boston Public Schools MAP Reading data extracts, September 2024\u2013May 2025; CLA tutor session logs; external evaluation memo by Northeastern University, June 2025).\n\n## A Student's Progress\n\nWith written consent, Yesenia Santos shared that her son, Luis (grade 5 at P.S. 117), began the year reading below grade level. After two weekly sessions for six months, he now reads aloud at home and picked his first chapter book on his own. Luis told us, \"I like when my tutor asks me questions that make me think.\"\n\n## Program Update\n\nWe reached full enrollment at all 38 schools by October and maintained 92% tutor retention through June\u2014our highest ever. Midyear, when scheduling conflicts arose at five schools, we added virtual session options and retained 94% of those students. Our next milestone: onboarding begins in September 2025 for year two.\n\n## What's Next\n\nBrightWave Technologies' commitment to literacy and STEM pathways aligns perfectly with our vision. Your employee volunteers during October 2024 and February 2025 brought that partnership to life, and we were honored to hear your CEO's remarks at our Spring Breakfast on May 2. We'll send your next update in our annual report this fall, including early results from our new middle school writing initiative.\n\nThank you for believing in Boston students and in our work.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\n**Elena Park**  \nVP, Programs  \nepark@coastalliteracy.org | 617-555-0772\n\n**Thomas Greene**  \nSenior Director, Corporate Partnerships  \ntgreene@coastalliteracy.org\n\n---\n\n**Photo Suggestion:**  \nTutor and student reading side-by-side at a school library table (faces consented).  \n**Caption:** \"BrightWave volunteers and funding helped 2,486 students make strong reading gains this school year.\"  \n**Alt text:** \"Adult tutor smiling as a fifth-grade student follows along in a chapter book at a library table.\"",

As 8% of the total, BrightWave\u2019s support helped train 316 volunteer tutors (about $600 per trainee) and funded the data systems and school partnerships that enabled expansion to 38 Boston Public Schools.\n\nBy the numbers (SY24\u201325):\n- Students served: 2,486 in grades 3\u20138 across 38 schools\n- Tutoring delivered: 24,900 sessions, 45 minutes each\n- Reading outcomes (MAP Reading): +0.6 grade levels average growth from fall to spring (district average +0.4)\n- 68% of participating students met or exceeded growth targets (vs 52% in SY23\u201324)\n\nSources: Boston Public Schools MAP Reading data extracts (Sept 2024\u2013May 2025); CLA tutor session logs (Salesforce); external evaluation memo by Northeastern University (June 2025).\n\nBeneficiary story\nWith written consent, Yesenia Santos shared that her son, Luis (grade 5 at P.S. 117), began the year reading below grade level.

Milestones: 316 tutors onboarded; new school partnerships in Dorchester and East Boston. Challenges: Winter attendance dips and a few school scheduling changes. We addressed these with make-up sessions, text reminders to families, and flexible tutor shifts. Next key milestone: By September 2025, publish the full SY24\u201325 evaluation summary and refresh training to strengthen nonfiction literacy tied to science texts\u2014an area BrightWave champions.\n\nPhoto suggestion: Tutor and student reading side-by-side at a school library table (faces consented).\nCaption: \u201cBrightWave volunteers and funding helped 2,486 students make strong reading gains this school year.\u201d\nAlt text: \u201cAdult tutor smiling as a fifth-grade student follows along in a chapter book at a library table.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next\nWe\u2019ll share your next update in September 2025 with the full evaluation highlights and plans for SY25\u201326.
