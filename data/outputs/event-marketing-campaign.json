The warm tone is pitch-perfect, the tactical detail is outstanding, and the dignity-first framing throughout ('dignified food access,' avoiding desperation language) reflects genuine nonprofit values. Minor accuracy issue: the timeline math is slightly confusing given the compressed start date, but the plan acknowledges and addresses this.",

          "Exceptional tactical specificity: exact dates, word counts met precisely, UTM structure fully built out, actual subject lines and body copy ready to use with minimal editing",
          "Warm, community-centered tone executed flawlessly throughout\u2014'neighbors sharing a table,' 'bring a neighbor,' 'cozy community night'\u2014never corporate or transactional",
          "Dignity-first messaging consistently applied: 'dignified, healthy food access,' never 'feeding the hungry' or poverty-porn framing; accessibility woven throughout (alt text, ASL, scent-aware seating)",
          "Realistic resource constraints honored: volunteer designer/photographer, $0-$300 budget tiers, 6-8 hrs/week staff time, compressed timeline acknowledged with practical workaround",
          "Smart course-correction plan at W-2 with concrete actions (phone tree, NEIGHBOR5 code, faith/school insertions) rather than vague 'boost efforts'",
          "Excellent partner activation toolkit with unique UTMs per partner, two distinct outreach emails (faith vs. business), and QR code strategy for print",
          "FOMO/urgency levers handled ethically: 'almost full' paired with value statements, never guilt or pressure; price increases clearly justified",
          "'How did you hear about us?' field integration is sophisticated and maps to UTM sources for true attribution",
          "Email resend strategy included with tweaked subject line, segment logic clear throughout",
          "Social plan balances platforms appropriately (Nextdoor for hyperlocal, IG for visuals) with specific best times and caption variety",

          "Approval flow lists Alex Rivera as both preparer and approver with no ED sign-off on final comms, which contradicts the ED approval role described earlier\u2014likely a template artifact",

The warm tone is consistent throughout, the deliverables are concrete and schedulable, and the plan balances ambition with realism. Minor timeline inconsistencies and a few overly optimistic assumptions prevent a perfect score, but this would be immediately usable by a real organization.",

          "Excellent accessibility integration throughout - alt text for every image, ASL interpretation notes, dietary accommodations, readable fonts mentioned consistently rather than as afterthought",
          "Realistic resource allocation for small nonprofit context - acknowledges volunteer capacity (3 hrs/week), provides free tool alternatives, includes contingency plans if under-target at W-2",
          "Strong measurement framework - UTM table is complete, 'How did you hear?' dropdown is specific and actionable, weekly reporting cadence is sustainable",
          "Warm, dignity-centered tone that avoids desperation - urgency language emphasizes opportunity and community ('join us,' 'don't miss out') rather than guilt or scarcity pressure",
          "Partner activation toolkit is comprehensive and turnkey - includes unique tracking links, sample posts in multiple formats, email templates with appropriate length and tone",
          "Budget flexibility is well-structured - clear $0/$100/$300 tiers with specific allocations make it easy for leadership to approve incremental spending",

          "Timeline inconsistency: The plan states it's an 8-week campaign (April 2-May 2) but the week-by-week section shows W-8 through W-1, then references 'April 29-May 1' as 72-hour push when event is May 2 - this creates confusion about whether it's truly 4 weeks (April 2-May 2) or 8 weeks",
          "Overly ambitious social media cadence for stated capacity - 2-3 posts/week across 3 platforms plus daily Instagram Stories in final week totals 25+ posts in 30 days, which may strain the 4 hrs/week volunteer allocation, especially with graphic creation",
          "Email list size assumption may be optimistic - sending to 1,200-contact house list but Mailchimp free tier caps at 500 contacts (noted in budget section), so the $0 budget scenario isn't actually viable without immediate $13/month upgrade",
          "Minor formatting inconsistency in Post 12 caption - states 'TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT' and 'starts at 6 p.m.' but is scheduled for May 1 at 10am and 5pm when event is May 2, creating potential confusion"

          "Partner activation toolkit is comprehensive and realistic\u2014includes QR codes, UTMs, sample copy at multiple lengths, and acknowledges different partner types (hiring vs. community orgs)",
          "SMART goals with realistic funnel math and clear attribution strategy via 'How did you hear' field; weekly reporting cadence and course-correct triggers show strategic thinking",
          "Social plan balances promotion with value/education (accessibility post, 'what to expect') and includes live event coverage, not just pre-event marketing",
          "Budget tiering ($0/$300/$1000) gives real options and the $0 plan is genuinely viable, not a token gesture",

          "The 'resend to non-openers' strategy for emails 2 and 4 lacks specific new subject line examples, only providing generic placeholders",
          "PR outlet list is strong but could benefit from one or two tech-specific or Latinx media outlets beyond general Chicago news",

Minor weaknesses include some repetitive phrasing and a few overly optimistic conversion rate assumptions.",

          "Strong accessibility integration throughout (alt text for every visual, ASL interpretation notes, quiet room mentions, caption requirements) rather than treating it as an afterthought",
          "Realistic resource allocation with hour estimates per role and clear sign-off workflows appropriate for a 25-person organization",
          "Partner/board activation toolkit is exceptionally well-designed with ready-to-send templates, unique tracking codes, and specific outreach windows",

          "Conversion rate assumptions are optimistic (15-20% across channels) for a $10 paid event; industry benchmarks for event registration are typically 5-10%, which could set unrealistic expectations",

          "Highly specific and actionable: exact dates, word counts met (80-120 word email templates), UTM schemes, conversion assumptions, and channel-specific KPIs make this genuinely schedulable",
          "Sophisticated funnel modeling: 12% landing page conversion, 15% click-to-reg, partner leaderboard tracking, and 'How did you hear?' field show professional-grade measurement thinking",
          "Excellent accessibility integration: alt text requirements, live captioning, pronoun ribbons, wheelchair access, and accessible label on tracking field\u2014not afterthoughts but embedded throughout",
          "Smart urgency architecture: four distinct levers (early-bird, price tiers, capacity, speaker reveals) with specific dates and sample language that creates FOMO without desperation",
          "Practical partner activation: unique UTM/QR codes per partner, two-send ask with specific weeks, recognition incentive, and 6-registration-per-partner target is realistic and trackable",
          "Strong course-correction plan: specific threshold (320 at W-2), five concrete tactics (preview webinar, LinkedIn DMs, daily X), and tiered budget options from $0-6k",
          "Appropriate formal tone throughout: 'convenes,' 'advance health-protective,' 'equity-centered,' 'guarantee your seat'\u2014language fits a national policy organization without being stiff",
          "Comprehensive role assignments: estimated hours per week for five roles including volunteer corps, 24-hour sign-off flow is realistic for this org size"

          "Self-approval notation: 'Prepared by Daniel Cho... approved by Daniel Cho' is technically correct per the scenario but looks odd; real plan would show ED or board approval",
          "YouTube strategy underdeveloped: only 2k impression target and two videos feels light for an 8-week campaign; could specify upload schedule, playlist, or embed strategy",
          "Missing scholarship process detail: mentions 'reply for scholarship options' and 'scholarships available' but doesn't specify who approves, criteria, or how many budgeted"
