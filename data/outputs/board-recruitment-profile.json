This leader's presence signals to South Side residents, funders, and partners that we are locally governed, not a Loop-based organization treating the South Side as a \"service area.\"\n\n### Responsibilities & Time Commitment\n- **Board meetings:** Quarterly (two in-person downtown, two virtual), ~2 hours each\n- **Committee assignment:** South Side Hub Advisory Committee (forming; will meet monthly during site search and build-out, then quarterly post-launch); ~1.5 hours/meeting\n- **Community engagement:** Occasional attendance at South Side community meetings or stakeholder listening sessions (estimated 3\u20134 events/year, evenings or Saturdays, 2 hours each)\n- **Estimated total:** 6\u20138 hours/month during hub planning (next 18 months); 3\u20134 hours/month post-launch  \n- **Annual hours:** ~60\u201375\n- **Location:** South Side residency or deep South Side professional presence strongly preferred\n\n### Fundraising Expectations\n- **Annual commitment:** $5,000 give-or-get\u2014recognizing this may be fulfilled through employer matches, family foundation connections, church or civic organization sponsorships, or in-kind contributions (e.g., donated facility planning services)\n- **100% participation expected; flexible pathways valued**\n- **Non-monetary actions valued:** Introduce ChiTech to South Side anchor institutions (hospitals, universities, manufacturers) for employer partnerships; host or facilitate a community listening session; share program stories at South Side civic meetings; connect us to South Side philanthropies (Chicago Community Trust South Side initiatives, Polk Bros.

Attend one community meeting or site visit with staff  \n5. Board vote\n\n**Sample Screening Questions:**\n1. Describe your South Side community involvement. What organizations or networks do you engage with regularly, and how would those relationships inform ChiTech's hub planning?\n2. We're weighing facility options: lease commercial space, partner with a South Side anchor (church, school, library), or pursue a community land trust model. What factors should guide that decision to ensure community benefit and avoid displacement?\n3. A funder offers significant capital support but wants the hub in a rapidly gentrifying corridor with limited bus access for our target participants. How would you advise the board?\n4. Our $5,000 give-or-get can include in-kind contributions and employer matches. What pathway feels realistic for you, and what support would help you meet it?\n5.

All three profiles are concrete, actionable, and would genuinely guide recruitment without a search firm. Minor weaknesses include slightly formulaic structure across profiles and one potential accuracy concern around the $25K give/get for the HR profile.",
        "strengths": [
          "Exceptional tone execution: achieves 'casual' without sacrificing professionalism\u2014uses contractions, direct address ('let's talk'), plain language ('what broke?'), and conversational asides ('your expertise *is* the contribution') that feel authentic to how EDs actually communicate",
          "Highly specific, non-generic content: avoids clich\u00e9s entirely; every 'must-have' is concrete (e.g., 'FERPA, COPPA, accessibility standards' not 'technology expertise'; 'UHNW individuals capable of six- to seven-figure gifts' not 'fundraising experience')",
          "Excellent diversity language: non-tokenizing, mission-linked explanations for why perspectives matter (e.g., 'ensures our campaign reflects communities we serve and builds sustainable funding streams' vs. generic 'we value diversity')",
          "Realistic time commitments with granular detail: breaks down hours by committee, events, seasonal intensity ('heavy Oct\u2013May with summer downtime'), and provides annual totals that feel credible for the roles described",
          "Thoughtful support structures: shows understanding of barriers busy professionals face (batch meetings, asynchronous input, travel stipends, childcare/elder care, West Coast time zones) and how to mitigate them",
          "Strategic screening questions: each set is role-specific, behavioral, and would actually surface relevant experience (e.g., 'What broke? What worked?' for scaling; 'balance board confidentiality with staff transparency' for HR)",
          "Smart sourcing avenues: mix of obvious and creative channels, including internal pipelines (gala leadership circle, educator alumni) and equity-focused networks (Code2040, Latinx Philanthropy Network) that align with stated diversity goals",
          "Outreach blurbs are compelling: each stays within word count, leads with impact/urgency, specifies the value proposition, and includes a clear call-to-action with personality",
          "Excellent governance details: conflict-of-interest protocols, background checks tied to youth contact (not blanket), bank KYC for officers, gift acceptance policies\u2014shows real understanding of nonprofit compliance",
          "Strong differentiation across profiles: each has distinct voice and emphasis (campaign urgency vs. scaling complexity vs. succession planning) while maintaining consistent structure"

        "weaknesses": [
          "Slight structural repetition: while content is highly differentiated, the formatting becomes predictable (same heading hierarchy, same section order across all three)\u2014a small variation in presentation might feel more organic",
          "The $25K give/get for Profile 3 (HR) may be unrealistic: HR executives, even senior ones, often earn less than campaign leaders or tech executives and may not have comparable philanthropic networks; the prompt allows flexibility but the output doesn't differentiate the ask across profiles despite different wealth-access levels",
          "Minor authenticity concern: phrases like 'heightened confidentiality for personnel matters' and 'adherence to gift acceptance and ethics policies' occasionally drift toward formal/legal register that slightly undercuts the casual tone (though this may be unavoidable for compliance language)",
          "The 'How busy professionals succeed' sections, while helpful, use nearly identical framing across profiles ('We batch meetings,' 'We respect boundaries')\u2014varying the language here would reduce the sense of template-filling"
