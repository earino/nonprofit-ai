We're ready to bring Creative Code Labs to Boston, Detroit, and Phoenix. **Would you and Arjun consider a $500,000 commitment over two years\u2014$250,000 per year\u2014to expand this work and continue the rigorous evaluation that matters to you?**\"*\n\n**Pause Plan:** 10-second silence after the ask. Elena maintains eye contact; Jordan and Rina do not speak.\n\n---\n\n## TAILORED TALKING POINTS\n\n1. **Oakland Pilot Results (2024):**  \n   - 47 teachers trained; 320 students (68% girls, 74% students of color) participated  \n   - 22% average gain in coding proficiency (AIR evaluation); 89% of students reported increased confidence in STEM  \n   - One student, *Maya*, used her hackathon project to win a community scholarship\u2014now studying computer science  \n\n2. **Expansion Blueprint (Boston, Detroit, Phoenix):**  \n   - Replicates Oakland model: 12-week teacher PD + student Saturday labs + family showcases  \n   - Year 1: 135 teachers, 960 students across three cities; Year 2: deepen + sustainability planning  \n   - Partners: Boston Public Schools, Detroit Future Schools, Phoenix Tech Collaborative (MOUs signed)  \n\n3. **Evaluation & Accountability:**  \n   - American Institutes for Research (AIR) continues as third-party evaluator; quarterly dashboards with learning outcomes, demographics, teacher satisfaction  \n   - Student stories shared with **first names only**; photo consent protocols in place  \n\n4. **Recognition Tailored to Priya's Preferences:**  \n   - Option to name a **\"Shah Family Creative Code Cohort\"** (Boston, Detroit, or Phoenix) or lab space  \n   - Quarterly data dashboards + 2\u20133 student story vignettes (privacy-protected)  \n   - Press release post-agreement; no gala spotlight  \n\n5. **Sustainability Beyond Year 2:**  \n   - District cost-sharing begins Year 2; goal is 50% district funding by Year 3  \n   - National model toolkit (open-source) by end of Year 2 for broader replication  \n\n---\n\n## QUESTIONS TO ASK (Open-Ended)\n\n1. **\"What excites you most about expanding Creative Code Labs to these three cities?\"**  \n2. **\"How do you and Arjun typically make decisions on multi-year commitments through the Shah Family Foundation?\"** *[Probe: timing, co-sign threshold, advisor involvement]*  \n3. **\"For a gift of this size, do you prefer to give through your private foundation, DAF, or appreciated stock?\"**  \n4. **\"Would you like a single two-year agreement letter, or do you prefer annual letters with progress updates?\"**  \n5. **\"We're planning site visits to Detroit in Q1 2026\u2014would you and Arjun be interested in joining to meet students and teachers?\"**  \n6. **\"AIR has been our evaluation partner; do you have a preference or would you like us to explore other evaluators for this expansion?\"**  \n\n---\n\n## LIKELY CONCERNS + RESPONSES\n\n| **Concern** | **Response** |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| *\"How do I know this will work in cities with different contexts than Oakland?\"* | \"Great question. We chose Boston, Detroit, and Phoenix because district partners have existing STEM infrastructure and signed MOUs. AIR will track city-specific outcomes and adaptations\u2014so you'll see what works where, and we'll adjust in real time.\" |\n| *\"Can you guarantee the same learning gains?\"* | \"We can't guarantee identical numbers, but we're using the same curriculum, teacher training model, and AIR evaluation. Oakland's 22% gain gives us a strong baseline; we'll report quarterly on progress and challenges.\" |\n| *\"What happens if one city underperforms?\"* | \"AIR's evaluation will flag challenges early. We have contingency funds (5% of budget) and a quarterly steering committee\u2014if one site struggles, we'll pivot resources or pause expansion there rather than compromise quality.\" |\n| *\"Will this lead to asks for 10 more cities next year?\"* | \"No. This is a **three-city, two-year expansion**\u2014intentionally limited. Our goal is to refine the model and create an open-source toolkit by Year 2, so other funders and districts can replicate without ongoing NAEA dependency.\" |\n\n---\n\n## WHAT NOT TO SAY\n\n- **Do NOT** mention Nimbus Cloud corporate partnership, layoffs, or tie this gift to Priya's role as SVP Product  \n- **Do NOT** promise expansion to NYC or reference pending NYC DOE contract (not finalized)  \n- **Do NOT** overpromise national scale beyond Boston, Detroit, Phoenix  \n- **Do NOT** use jargon: \"stakeholder engagement,\" \"theory of change,\" \"collective impact\"  \n- **Do NOT** put Priya on the spot about Arjun's involvement\u2014ask open-ended question about decision process  \n\n---\n\n## LOGISTICS & CHOREOGRAPHY\n\n**Agenda (60 min):**  \n- **0:00\u20130:05** \u2013 Welcome; gratitude for 2024 partnership  \n- **0:05\u20130:15** \u2013 Oakland pilot results + student story (Elena; share 1-pager with photos)  \n- **0:15\u20130:30** \u2013 Expansion plan: cities, partners, budget, evaluation (Jordan presents; Rina distributes budget summary)  \n- **0:30\u20130:35** \u2013 **The Ask** (Elena; 10-second pause)  \n- **0:35\u20130:50** \u2013 Q&A; explore decision process, timing, recognition preferences  \n- **0:50\u20130:55** \u2013 Recognition options + reporting plan (Rina)  \n- **0:55\u20131:00** \u2013 Next steps; thank you  \n\n**Materials to Bring (Print 4 Copies Each, 12\u201314 pt, High Contrast):**  \n- 1-page Oakland Pilot Impact Summary (with student photo + quote)  \n- 2-page Expansion Budget Overview (link: https://naea.org/files/FY25_CCL_budget.pdf)  \n- Sample quarterly dashboard mockup  \n- Recognition options menu (cohort naming, lab space plaque, press release draft)  \n\n**Accessibility Note:** Boardroom has natural light; confirm AV setup for laptop if Priya requests data walkthrough.\n\n---\n\n## POST-MEETING PLAN\n\n**Thank-You (Owner: Elena; Due: Within 48 Hours):**  \n- Handwritten note referencing specific conversation points  \n- Email recap with attachments: proposal PDF, budget, evaluation summary, recognition menu  \n\n**Next Steps (Owners + Due Dates):**  \n1. **If YES to $500K:** Rina drafts agreement letter by Dec 9; Elena schedules call with Kiran Desai (foundation counsel) by Dec 12; board approval for recognition (if naming) by Dec 15. *[UNKNOWN: Multi-year agreement letter vs annual letters; Arjun co-sign required?]*  \n2. **If $350K\u2013$400K fallback:** Jordan revises budget for two-city launch (Boston + Detroit); Elena sends revised proposal by Dec 9.  \n3. **If site visit interest:** Rina coordinates Detroit visit logistics for Q1 2026 (check Priya + Arjun calendars). *[UNKNOWN: Availability for Detroit site visit in Q1 2026.]*  \n4. **If need to loop in Arjun/Kiran:** Elena sends calendar hold for follow-up call week of Dec 9.  \n\n**CRM Updates (Owner: Rina; Due: Dec 6, 2025):**  \n- Log contact report (attendees, ask delivered, response, concerns, next steps)  \n- Update solicitation stage (Negotiation if positive; Cultivation if deferred)  \n- Flag **UNKNOWNS** for follow-up: preferred asset (DAF vs foundation vs stock), co-sign requirement, multi-year agreement format, evaluation partner preference, Detroit visit availability  \n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** Rina Sato, Development Operations Manager | **Date:** Nov 29, 2025 | **Version:** 1.0  \n**Reviewed by:** Jordan Hale, Chief of Staff | Elena Morales, Executive Director\n\n---\n\n**CONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Do Not Distribute Outside Meeting Attendees**",
