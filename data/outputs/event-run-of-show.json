Cuts would come from the \"Last Chance Silent Auction/Mingling\" buffer (5 mins) or early end to dinner music.\n*   **Tech Failure (Slides/Sound):**\n    *   **Decision Maker:** Jasmine Ortiz (Producer) & David Chen (AV Lead).\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   **Slides:** If primary projector fails, immediately switch to backup screen (if available) or rely on verbal communication. Marisol Vega (MC) will verbally describe key information (e.g., Fund-a-Need levels). Printouts of donation levels and CRYC info will be immediately distributed to tables.\n        *   **Sound:** If MC mic fails, Marisol will switch to a handheld mic (CH1/CH2). If all mics fail, she will project her voice and request quiet. Pre-recorded music backups are loaded on a separate device.\n*   **Weather (Unexpected Rain/Cold for Outdoor Component - N/A for this event, as it is indoors):**\n    *   *Self-correcting, as event is fully indoors at Grange Hall.*\n*   **Running Significantly Behind (e.g., >10 minutes):**\n    *   **Decision Maker:** Jasmine Ortiz (Producer).\n    *   **Action:**\n        1.  **First 5 min cut:** Shorten \"Last Chance Silent Auction & Mingling\" (7:40-7:55 PM) by 5 min.\n        2.  **Next 5 min cut:** Marisol's \"Transition & Introduction of Fund-a-Need\" (6:45-6:50 PM) will be cut to 3 minutes; Maria Rodriguez's \"Volunteer Recognition\" (7:05-7:15 PM) will be cut by 2 minutes. Guests will be asked to hold applause for more than 3 seconds.\n        3.  **Hardest Cut:** Elder Thomas Red Sky's storytelling will be gently cued for a 1-2 minute wrap-up earlier (Ben Carter will signal). This is a last resort to maintain the hard stop.\n*   **Running Significantly Ahead (e.g., >10 minutes):**\n    *   **Decision Maker:** Jasmine Ortiz (Producer).\n    *   **Action:**\n        1.  **First 5 min add:** Marisol Vega will extend her \"Welcoming Warmth & Mingling\" initial circulation, or \"Dinner Service\" music will extend slightly.\n        2.  **Next 5 min add:** Marisol will facilitate table discussions (e.g., \"What makes Cedar Ridge special to you?\") or share additional brief anecdotes about CRYC's impact. Extended time for silent auction.\n\n---\n\n## Pronunciation Guide\n\n*   **Marisol Vega:** Mah-ree-SOHL  VAY-gah\n*   **Ana Ramirez:** AH-na  Rah-MEER-ez\n*   **Kalapuya:** Kah-LAH-poo-yah\n*   **Thomas Red Sky:** Thomas Red Sky (Standard pronunciation)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility Accommodations\n\n*   **ASL Interpretation:** Certified ASL interpreter present and clearly visible during all on-stage speaking segments (Ana Ramirez, Marisol Vega, Maria Rodriguez, Elder Thomas Red Sky).

(David Chen to confirm feasibility during prep).\n*   **Quiet Space:** A designated \"Quiet Room\" (e.g., a small side office at the Grange Hall) will be available for guests needing a low-sensory environment. Signage will be clear. (Maria Rodriguez to manage access).\n*   **Dietary Restrictions:** Catering has communicated clear markings for vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free options.

The warm, inclusive tone is perfectly calibrated for a rural community organization, and the level of operational detail makes it immediately usable. Minor deductions only for a few small technical details that could be refined.",

          "Highly practical operational details: explicit buffer strategies, realistic contingency plans with named decision-makers, clear catering/speech coordination to avoid plate-clearing during talks.",
          "Fund-a-Need script is masterfully done: specific dollar amounts tied to tangible outcomes ('$1,500 a month for one route = 10-15 more kids'), visual cues for MC, runner coordination, and real-time tracking.",
          "Accessibility is thoroughly integrated throughout rather than tacked on: ASL interpreter positioning, caption notes, quiet space, large print, mobility considerations at every segment.",
          "Staffing grid is realistic and complete: includes cell numbers, call times, primary comms channel, and appropriate volunteer roles for a 120-person community event.",
          "Timeline buffers are explicitly shown and strategically placed: 10%+ buffer built in with clear instructions on where to cut (shorten mingling, reduce table circulation) if running behind.",
          "Speaker guides are practical: realistic time limits, 'if over time' cut lines, discreet warning signals from staff, and key talking points without over-scripting.",
          "AV/Tech sheet is production-ready: channel assignments, file names with extensions, specific GO cues for show-caller, lighting looks, and music volume levels.",
          "At-a-Glance volunteer guide is genuinely useful: simplified timeline, friendly tone, contact info, and practical reminders ('Silenced during speeches, please!')."

          "The 20-minute Elder Red Sky segment (7:15-7:35 PM) followed immediately by only 5 minutes for wrap-up and silent auction final call (7:35-7:40 PM) creates timing risk if the storytelling runs long, despite the noted flexibility.",
          "Fundraising thermometer slide requires 'live update' but no specific instruction on who updates it or how (manual slide advance vs. pre-programmed increments vs. live editing)."

I'm Marisol Vega, board chair of Cedar Ridge Youth Collective, and it is so good to see you here. Thank you for coming out on a Saturday evening\u2014we know how precious your weekends are. Before we begin, I want to honor the land we're gathering on. Cedar Ridge sits on the ancestral homelands of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who have stewarded these forests, rivers, and valleys since time immemorial. We acknowledge their enduring connection to this place and commit to walking in right relationship with Indigenous neighbors. Tonight is about community\u2014breaking bread, sharing stories, and building a future where every young person in Cedar Ridge can thrive. Let's get started.\n\n**Transition to Dinner:**\n> In just a moment, we'll invite you to line up for supper.

I want to introduce you to someone who reminds me why we do this work. Anika Patel is a junior at Cedar Ridge High School. She's on the robotics team, she tutors middle schoolers in math, and she's one of the most determined people I know. Two years ago, Anika almost had to quit our after-school program because her mom's work schedule changed and she had no way to get home. Transportation\u2014something so simple\u2014was going to cost her a community that believed in her. Anika, will you come up and share your story?\n\n#### SPEAKER GUIDE: Anika Patel (6:52 PM \u2013 6:58 PM, 6 minutes max)\n\n**Key Points:**\n- What after-school program meant to you before transportation became an issue\n- The moment you thought you'd have to quit (specific, emotional detail)\n- How the Youth Collective's volunteer drivers stepped in\n- What you've been able to accomplish because you stayed connected (robotics team, tutoring, friendships)\n- What it would mean for other kids to have reliable transportation\n\n**Time Limit:** 6 minutes (hard stop at 6:58 PM for pacing)\n\n**If Over Time (cut after 5 minutes):** Skip robotics team details; go straight to \"what reliable transportation would mean for other kids.\"\n\n**Video Cue (6:52 PM):** After Anika speaks for 1 minute, Tyler cues \"Anika_Testimonial.mp4\" (2:45 video of Anika at robotics competition, mentoring younger students, and riding home with volunteer driver Mrs. Nakamura). Anika remains on stage; video plays on screen.\n\n**Closing (Anika, 6:55 PM):**\n> Thank you for being here tonight. Every time you show up, you're saying that kids like me matter. I hope you'll help us make sure no kid has to choose between staying connected and getting home safely.\n\n**MC TRANSITION (Marisol, 6:58 PM):**\n> Thank you, Anika. Let's hear it for her. *(Pause for applause.)* That's why we're here\u2014so every young person has a shot. We'll talk more about transportation in a bit, but first, dessert.\n\n---\n\n### DESSERT SERVICE & SILENT AUCTION CLOSING: 6:58 PM \u2013 7:20 PM\n\n| Time | Duration | Segment | On-Stage/Mic | Owner | AV Cues | Materials/Props | Accessibility |\n|------|----------|---------|--------------|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------|\n| 6:58 PM | 22 min | **Dessert Service & Auction Close** | N/A | Antonio Garcia, Catering Lead | **MUSIC:** \"Dessert Mix\" (Spotify playlist: HarvestSupper_2025_Dessert) at 50% volume<br>**LIGHTS:** Ambient dining (Look 1) | Dessert platters (apple galette, berry crisp, coffee/tea) | Catering staff deliver desserts to tables |\n\n**Service Cues:**\n- **6:58 PM:** Clear dinner plates\n- **7:00 PM:** Deliver dessert platters to all tables\n- **7:10 PM:** Coffee/tea service begins\n\n**Silent Auction Closing Announcement (7:20 PM \u2013 Marisol on Mic 1):**\n> Friends, just a heads-up: our silent auction closes in ten minutes.

This has been a remarkable year for Cedar Ridge Youth Collective. We served 87 young people across three after-school sites\u2014up from 62 last year. We launched a middle school mentorship program that paired eighth graders with local business owners. We ran weekend field trips to the coast, the state capitol, and Oregon State University. And here's the thing: none of it would've happened without volunteers. \n\n> *(Slide 3: \"2024-25 Impact\" \u2013 numbers, photos of kids at programs)*\n\n> I want to call out a few people who've gone above and beyond. Mrs. Lily Nakamura has driven kids home three afternoons a week for two years\u2014rain, shine, snow. Lily, stand up. *(Applause.)* Tom Reyes from Reyes Hardware donated supplies for our woodworking shop and taught kids how to build birdhouses. Tom, thank you. *(Applause.)* And the entire teaching staff at Cedar Ridge Elementary opened their classrooms after hours so we could run homework help. Teachers, if you're here, please stand. *(Applause.)*\n\n> *(Slide 4: \"Volunteer Shout-Outs\" \u2013 photos of volunteers)*\n\n> If you've driven a kid home, packed a snack, showed up for a field trip, or just believed in this work\u2014this is for you. *(Hold up cedar box.)* We have a small gift for every volunteer here tonight. After the program, please grab one from the table by the door. You are the heartbeat of this community.\n\n**IF OVER TIME (cut after 6 minutes):** Skip individual volunteer names; say \"Every volunteer here tonight, please stand\u2014this is for you.\"\n\n**Transition to Paddle Raise (7:28 PM):**\n> Now, let's talk about what's next. You've heard Anika's story. You know transportation is the barrier keeping too many kids from showing up. We want to expand our volunteer driver program and add two new routes this fall. To do that, we need your help. I'm going to invite our Executive Director, Carla Munoz, to explain how you can make that happen tonight.\n\n---\n\n### PADDLE RAISE FUND-A-NEED: 7:35 PM \u2013 7:55 PM\n\n| Time | Duration | Segment | On-Stage/Mic | Owner | AV Cues | Materials/Props | Accessibility |\n|------|----------|---------|--------------|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------|\n| 7:35 PM | 20 min | **Paddle Raise Fund-a-Need: Transportation Expansion** | **Emcee:** Carla Munoz, Executive Director (Mic 1 \u2013 handheld)<br>**Support:** Tyler Ng (Mic 2 \u2013 backstage, for announcements) | Tyler Ng, Show-Caller | **MUSIC:** Soft underscore (\"Fund-a-Need_Underscore.mp3\") at 30% volume (starts at 7:35, loops, fades at 7:55)<br>**LIGHTS:** Bright stage focus (Look 3)<br>**SLIDES:** Slide 5 \u2013 \"Paddle Raise: Transportation Fund\" (HarvestSupper_Deck.pptx, 7:35 mark)<br>Slide 6 \u2013 Thermometer graphic (updates live as pledges come in) | Numbered paddles (1\u2013120) distributed to all tables before segment<br>Pledge forms and pens at each table<br>2 volunteer \"spotters\" (Maria Lopez, David Kim) with handheld mics to capture pledges | ASL interpreter on-stage left<br>Live captions<br>Spotters assist guests with mobility limitations |\n\n#### PADDLE RAISE SCRIPT: Carla Munoz (7:35 PM \u2013 7:55 PM)\n\n**SETUP (7:35 PM \u2013 7:38 PM, 3 minutes):**\n\n> Hi, everyone. I'm Carla Munoz, Executive Director of Cedar Ridge Youth Collective. You've been so generous already tonight\u2014thank you. Now I'm going to ask you to dig a little deeper, because this is the moment that changes lives. \n\n> Here's the reality: we have 23 young people on our waitlist right now. Most of them live in rural areas\u2014up Miller Creek Road, out past Birch Hollow, along Highway 22. Their parents work evenings, or they don't have cars, or the bus doesn't run their route. Transportation is the difference between a kid showing up for robotics club or sitting home alone. It's the difference between a teenager getting mentoring or slipping through the cracks.\n\n> Tonight, we're raising $20,000 to expand our transportation program. That will fund two new volunteer driver routes, cover gas stipends and insurance for a year, and purchase safety equipment. Every dollar you give tonight goes directly to getting kids where they need to be.\n\n> *(Slide 5: \"Paddle Raise: Transportation Fund\" \u2013 image of kids boarding van, smiling driver)*\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS (7:38 PM \u2013 7:40 PM, 2 minutes):**\n\n> Here's how this works. At your table, you'll find a numbered paddle. When I call out a giving level, if you're willing to give at that level, raise your paddle high. Our volunteer spotters\u2014Maria and David, wave so people can see you\u2014will come to you with a pledge form. You can pay tonight by check or card, or we'll send you an invoice next week. This is a pledge, not a payment\u2014so don't worry if you don't have your checkbook. We trust you.\n\n> A few things: every gift matters. If I call out $1,000 and you can only do $500, wait for the $500 level\u2014we're going all the way down. If you'd rather give privately, there are pledge forms on your table; fill one out and drop it in the basket at the door. And if you can't give tonight but you want to volunteer as a driver, there's a sign-up sheet in the lobby. Driving is giving.\n\n> Ready? Let's do this.\n\n**PADDLE RAISE SEQUENCE (7:40 PM \u2013 7:52 PM, 12 minutes):**\n\n| Time | Ask Level | Script | Visual Cue | Spotter Action |\n|------|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|\n| 7:40 | $5,000 | \"Let's start at $5,000.

Marisol extends Volunteer Recognition segment (add table shout-outs, stretch to 7:00 PM).\n2. If Anika arrives by 7:00 PM, insert testimonial before Paddle Raise (shorten to 4 min; skip video).\n3. If Anika does not arrive by 7:00 PM, Marisol reads prepared statement (1-min version of Anika's story) and shows video only. Paddle Raise proceeds on time.\n\n**Prepared Statement (Marisol):**\n> Anika Patel was supposed to be here tonight, but life happens. Let me tell you why her story matters. Two years ago, Anika almost quit our after-school program because she had no way to get home. A volunteer driver\u2014Mrs. Nakamura\u2014stepped in. Today, Anika's on the robotics team, she's tutoring middle schoolers, and she's thriving. That's what transportation makes possible. Let's watch a quick video, and then we'll talk about how you can help more kids like Anika.\n\n**If Carla is late (7:35 PM Paddle Raise):**\n1. Marisol emcees Paddle Raise using Carla's script (provided in advance).\n2. Tyler Ng assists with running totals via Mic 3.\n\n**Decision-Maker:** Jasmine Ortiz (Producer) consults with Tyler Ng (Show-Caller); final call by 6:45 PM.\n\n---\n\n### TECH FAILURE\n\n**If slide deck fails:**\n- Proceed without slides; Marisol/Carla narrate key points (impact numbers, sponsor names, etc.).\n- Backup: Printed poster boards with impact stats, thermometer graphic (foam core, placed on easel near stage).\n\n**If video fails (Anika_Testimonial.mp4):**\n- Anika speaks for full 6 minutes (no video interruption).\n- Marisol references video content verbally: \"Anika's also been to robotics nationals, mentored younger students, and built deep friendships\u2014all because she had a ride home.\"\n\n**If mics fail:**\n- Marisol, Carla, Anika project voices (Grange Hall acoustics support unamplified speech for 120 people).\n- Tyler Ng moves to front of room, repeats key points for back rows.\n\n**If power outage:**\n- Battery-powered lanterns (stored in kitchen) distributed to tables.\n- Marisol proceeds with abbreviated program: thank-you, Paddle Raise (verbal pledges only, no thermometer), dismissal.\n- Guests may leave early if uncomfortable; no hard feelings.\n\n**Decision-Maker:** Tyler Ng (tech troubleshooting); Jasmine Ortiz (program adjustments).\n\n---\n\n### WEATHER (Outdoor elements: parking, entrance)\n\n**If heavy rain (June in Oregon = likely):**\n- Volunteers stationed at entrance with umbrellas to escort guests from parking lot.\n- Extra floor mats inside entrance to prevent slipping.\n- Catering adjusts setup to avoid drafts from door.\n\n**If extreme heat (85\u00b0F+):**\n- Fans positioned around room (Grange Hall lacks A/C).\n- Iced water stations at buffet and auction tables.\n- Shorten program by 5 minutes (cut Marisol's closing logistics).\n\n**Decision-Maker:** Jasmine Ortiz (day-of weather call by 3:00 PM).\n\n---\n\n### RUNNING \u00b110 MINUTES\n\n**If 10 Minutes Behind:**\n1. **Cut Marisol's Volunteer Recognition from 8 min to 5 min** (skip individual names; collective thank-you only).\n2. **Shorten Paddle Raise from 20 min to 15 min** (collapse $2,500/$1,000 levels; skip storytelling between asks).\n3. **Skip dessert buffer** (clear plates quickly; no coffee service).\n4. **Cut Marisol's Closing Remarks from 10 min to 7 min** (skip logistics; refer to program booklet).\n\n**If 10 Minutes Ahead:**\n1. Extend dessert service (allow guests to linger, chat).\n2. Marisol adds table shout-outs during Volunteer Recognition.\n3. Carla adds storytelling flourishes to Paddle Raise (e.g., \"Imagine a kid sitting in the parking lot, wondering if anyone will show up for them...\").\n\n**Decision-Maker:** Tyler Ng (Show-Caller) monitors time; consults Jasmine Ortiz (Producer) for cuts/adds. Calls made by 7:20 PM.\n\n---\n\n## PRONUNCIATION GUIDE\n\n| Name | Pronunciation | Role |\n|------|---------------|------|\n| Marisol Vega | mah-ree-SOUL VAY-gah | Board Chair, MC |\n| Carla Munoz | KAR-lah moo-NYOZ | Executive Director |\n| Anika Patel | ah-NEE-kah pah-TELL | Youth Speaker |\n| Lily Nakamura | LIL-ee nah-kah-MOOR-ah | Volunteer Driver |\n| Jasmine Ortiz | JAZ-min or-TEEZ | Producer |\n| Antonio Garcia | an-TOH-nee-oh gar-SEE-ah | Catering Lead |\n| Priya Patel | PREE-yah pah-TELL | Anika's parent |\n\n---\n\n## ACCESSIBILITY ACCOMMODATIONS\n\n### ASL Interpretation\n- **Interpreter:** Jordan Mills (certified, RID member)\n- **Positioning:** Stage left, visible to all guests\n- **Segments Covered:** All speaking segments (6:00 PM \u2013 8:05 PM)\n- **Breaks:** Jordan takes 10-min break during dessert service (6:58 PM \u2013 7:08 PM); no speaking during this window\n\n### Live Captions\n- **Platform:** CaptiView app (projected on screen alongside slides)\n- **Operator:** Sam Parker (tech operator) manages app\n- **Segments Covered:** All speaking segments\n\n### Mobility Accommodations\n- **Wheelchair-Accessible Seating:** Tables 1, 4, 7 (reserved; marked with \"Reserved\" signs)\n- **Accessible Entrance:** Ramp at main entrance (cleared of snow/debris)\n- **Restrooms:** Accessible restroom near main hall (marked with signage)\n- **Service Support:** Catering staff assist guests with mobility limitations at buffet\n\n### Quiet Space\n- **Location:** Grange kitchen (side door, marked with \"Quiet Space\" sign)\n- **Purpose:** Sensory break, nursing/pumping, overwhelm\n- **Staffed:** Maya Chen checks in periodically; guests may self-direct\n\n### Dietary Accommodations\n- All dishes labeled (GF, V, DF)\n- Nut-free guarantee (disclosed on signage)\n- Staff trained to answer ingredient questions\n\n---\n\n## LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\n**Delivered by:** Marisol Vega (6:00 PM, Welcome segment)\n\n**Text:**\n> Before we begin, I want to honor the land we're gathering on.

        "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally well-crafted run-of-show script that demonstrates deep understanding of both nonprofit event production and the specific community context. The warm, inclusive tone is perfectly calibrated for a rural community organization, and the level of detail makes it immediately actionable. Minor deductions only for slight over-explanation in some sections that could be streamlined.",
        "strengths": [
          "Outstanding tone consistency - scripts sound genuinely conversational and community-centered, not corporate or stilted (e.g., 'I hope you're enjoying the meal\u2014please keep eating' feels natural and hospitable)",
          "Exceptional attention to operational detail - explicit buffer management, quiet clearing cues during speeches, catering coordination, and accessibility accommodations are thorough and practical",
          "Highly usable contingency planning - specific, decision-tree style responses to late speakers, tech failures, and timing issues with clear decision-makers identified",
          "Culturally appropriate and authentic - land acknowledgment includes research attribution, pronunciation guide shows respect, volunteer recognition feels genuine rather than performative",
          "Professional AV/tech documentation - channel lists, GO calls, file locations, and show-caller scripts are industry-standard and immediately usable by technical staff",
          "Smart pacing and human-centered design - built-in breaks for ASL interpreter, 'if over time' cut lines for every speaker, and explicit instructions to avoid rushing guests demonstrate care",
          "Excellent speaker support - scripts are written in natural voice with clear time limits and graceful exit strategies, making speakers feel prepared rather than constrained",
          "Perfect calibration to small-org reality - $35K goal, 120 guests, Grange Hall venue, volunteer spotters, and Spotify playlists reflect actual resource constraints of rural nonprofits"
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
          "Slight redundancy in some sections - the buffer summary and contingency plans repeat timing information that could be consolidated for easier reference during live event",
          "The 1-page 'At-a-Glance' could be even more condensed - still runs dense for a quick-reference volunteer handout, though content is appropriate"

Late Speakers (Dr. Rodriguez, Lead Community Artist):**\n    *   **Who Decides:** Ariella Stone (Show-Caller) in consultation with Devon Brooks (Producer).\n    *   **Action Plan:**\n        *   **If 5-10 min late:** MC Aaliyah Rivera will extend her previous segment (intro, booth shout-outs) or engage in light audience interaction/Q&A about favorite art forms. Ariella will inform MC via earpiece. Speakers will be prepped for a slightly condensed speech upon arrival.\n        *   **If >10 min late:** Ariella will immediately cut the following segment's buffer (BUFFER 1) and potentially shorten the \"Open Exploration\" time. If the speaker cannot make it, Aaliyah will deliver a condensed version of their key points (information prepped in MC binder) and apologize for the absence.\n\n**2. Tech Failure (Audio, Video, Screen):**\n    *   **Who Decides:** Alex Kim (Tech Lead) and Ariella Stone (Show-Caller).\n    *   **Action Plan:**\n        *   **Audio (Mic issues):** Alex immediately troubleshoots. Ariella preps MC to switch to a wired backup mic or project voice loudly. If critical, MC directs crowd to activity booths while Alex works.\n        *   **Video (Screen/Projector issues):** Alex troubleshoots. Ariella directs MC to verbally describe visuals if slides are critical (e.g., Text-to-Give instructions). If it's ambient video, MC can acknowledge the issue and keep the program moving. Physical signage for Text-to-Give will be available.\n        *   **Power Outage:** (Less likely in park with generator, but possible.) Alex switches to backup generator or battery power for critical stage elements (mics, small speakers). MC will announce the issue, thank everyone for patience, and encourage enjoying booths/food trucks. Event may be ended early if prolonged.\n\n**3. Weather (Rain, High Winds, Extreme Heat):**\n    *   **Who Decides:** David Green (Site Lead) and Devon Brooks (Producer).\n    *   **Action Plan:**\n        *   **Light Rain/Drizzle:** MC announces that \"most activities are under tents,\" encourage pop-up shelters. Continue as planned, but monitor closely.\n        *   **Moderate Rain/Threat of Storms (Pre-event):** David/Devon will decide by 9:00 AM whether to activate \"Rain Plan\" (move select activities to nearby rec center if available, or cancel). Decision comms to all staff/volunteers via text/radio, and public via social media/website.\n        *   **Moderate Rain/Threat of Storms (During event):** David/Devon will make cancellation call. MC will announce immediate park evacuation instructions, direct attendees to designated exits/shelters. All staff assist with orderly departure.\n        *   **High Winds:** David may secure loose items, potentially take down banners/flags. MC will warn attendees about falling debris. If winds become dangerous, evacuation protocol.\n        *   **Extreme Heat:** Emily (Catering) ensures abundant water. David ensures cooling stations (misting fans, shaded tents) are well-advertised. MC reminds attendees to hydrate and seek shade. Program may be shortened if health risk.\n\n**4. Running \u00b110 Minutes (Ahead/Behind Schedule):**\n    *   **Who Decides:** Ariella Stone (Show-Caller).\n    *   **Action Plan:**\n        *   **Running Ahead:** Ariella will inform MC via earpiece. MC can:\n            *   Extend a segment with more audience interaction/Q&A.\n            *   Add an unscripted, brief \"mini-spotlight\" on a nearby artist/booth.\n            *   Extend BUFFER time deliberately (e.g., \"Take an extra 5, grab a snack!\").\n        *   **Running Behind:** Ariella will inform MC via earpiece. MC will:\n            *   Shorten the next buffer (e.g., \"BUFFER 1\" or \"BUFFER 3\").\n            *   Condense transition scripts slightly (Aaliyah is trained for natural, not rushed delivery).\n            *   Cut non-essential \"table shout-outs\" or general encouraging remarks.\n            *   Ariella may slightly shorten a less critical artist demo by 1-2 minutes if needed, with prior agreement from artist liaison. **Speeches of Dr. Rodriguez and Keynote/Community Artist will have time protected unless absolutely critical.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Check and Distribution:**\n\n**Producer (Devon Brooks)** to review entire document for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to goals.\n**Show-Caller (Ariella Stone)** to ensure all technical cues are precise and actionable.\n**MC (Aaliyah Rivera)** to confirm script feels natural and aligns with her voice.\n**All Leads** to confirm their sections are accurate.\n\n**Distribution Plan:**\n*   **August 5, 2025:** Final Run-of-Show, At-a-Glance Summary, Staffing Grid, and Speaker Guides distributed digitally (email/shared drive) to all staff, key volunteers, and speakers.\n*   **August 10, 2025:** Printed copies of At-a-Glance Summary for Volunteers provided at volunteer briefing. Printed copies of full Run-of-Show distributed to Production Team, Show-Caller, Tech Lead, MC, and Site Lead at final production meeting.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed run-of-show provides a robust framework for your \"Art in the Park Community Day.\" It balances structure with flexibility, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for all attendees while meeting Metro Arts Access's goals.

If 5+ minutes late, CEO (Dr. Vance) will share a brief impactful anecdote about a client. Time can be absorbed by slightly extending CEO remarks or MC transition.\n*   **Tech Failure (Video/Audio):** Nina Kapoor (Producer) decides.\n    *   **Action (Video):** If main video fails, switch to backup static \"Mission Statement\" slide. MC will verbally relay key points. If Mission Video fails, MC proceeds directly to CEO remarks. If Sterling Foundation video fails, Aaron Chu will verbally introduce the awardee with heightened descriptive language.\n    *   **Action (Audio):** If a mic fails, Stage Manager to quickly swap with spare. If all main mics fail, MC to use backup wired podium mic. In extreme scenario, speakers to project voice loudly; MC to reiterate crucial information.\n*   **Weather (Rain/Wind Impacting Entrance):** Samantha Chen (Volunteer Lead) decides on minor adjustments, Nina Kapoor on major.\n    *   **Action:** Implement designated covered pathways. Increase volunteer presence at entrance. Ensure clear signage for sheltered routes. Offer assistance with umbrellas/ponchos. If extreme, adjust music volume for indoor acoustics.\n*   **Running \u00b110 Minutes (Overall Timing):** Nina Kapoor (Producer) decides.\n    *   **Running Ahead:** Slow down the MC's transitions slightly, extend background music segments briefly, allow for longer networking time. MC can invite additional questions during pledge card section.\n    *   **Running Behind:**\n        *   **Shorten Welcome:** MC shortens opening remarks by 30 seconds.\n        *   **Reduce Interlude:** MC transition after testimonial is shortened from 5 min to 2 min.\n        *   **Streamline Fund-a-Need:** MC prioritizes high-value pledges and moves through levels more quickly, with fewer pauses for CEO comments. Cut $500 level if necessary.\n        *   **Speaker Cuts:** Speakers are advised in speaker guide to have an \"if over time\" cut line. Prod. will give 1-minute warning via earpiece. If they continue, MC will politely cut in after their stated cut line.\n\n---\n\n**Pronunciation Guide:**\n\n*   **Samir Patel:** SAH-meer Pah-TEL\n*   **Dr. Eleanor Vance:** EL-uh-nor VANCE\n*   **Maria Rodriguez:** Ma-REE-uh Rod-REE-gez\n*   **Aaron Chu:** AIR-un CHOO\n*   **Nina Kapoor:** NEE-nah Kah-POOR\n*   **Ramaytush Ohlone:** Rah-MY-toosh Oh-LOH-nee\n\n---\n\n**Accessibility Accommodations:**\n\n*   **ASL Interpreters:** Two professional ASL interpreters (Sarah Green, Tom Wong) will be present for all on-stage presentations and available for individual interactions during networking.

        "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally thorough and professional run-of-show script that demonstrates deep understanding of nonprofit event production. It fulfills nearly all template requirements with appropriate formality, practical detail, and usable formatting. The MC scripts sound natural and dignified, technical cues are precise, and contingency planning is realistic. Minor weaknesses include slightly formulaic phrasing in some transitions and the sheer length potentially overwhelming some users.",
        "strengths": [
          "Exceptional completeness - includes all requested elements: overview, minute-by-minute timeline, buffer time explicitly shown, MC scripts in appropriate formal tone, critical fundraising moment scripting with paddle raise mechanics, speaker guides with cut lines, comprehensive AV/tech sheet with GO cues, catering coordination, staffing grid with contact info, detailed contingency plans, pronunciation guide, accessibility accommodations, land acknowledgment, and both at-a-glance and printable timeline versions",
          "Highly practical and usable - the AV tech sheet with timestamped GO cues, channel assignments, and show-caller commands is production-ready; the staffing grid includes call times and communication channels; contingency plans specify who decides and concrete actions; the format is clean and scannable",
          "Appropriate formal tone throughout - MC scripts (Samir Patel) strike the right balance of warmth and polish for a major donor breakfast without being stiff or clich\u00e9d; language like 'esteemed guests,' 'profound gratitude,' and 'distinguished leaders' fits the audience and venue perfectly",
          "Excellent attention to fundraising mechanics - the paddle raise segment includes clear donor instructions, spotter logistics, visual cues, real-time tracking system, and specific impact statements for each giving level; pledge card timing is realistic with table captain coordination",
          "Strong accessibility integration - ASL interpreters, live captioning, quiet space, large print materials, and wheelchair access are woven throughout rather than treated as afterthought; interpreters are assigned specific positions and backup roles",
          "Realistic buffer management - 10%+ buffer time is built in and explicitly labeled with specific compression strategies (shorten welcome, reduce interlude, streamline fund-a-need, skip $500 level); shows understanding of event flow realities",
          "Professional technical detail - music playlists are named and cued with fade times, video files have runtime and timestamps, lighting looks are specified, mic channels are assigned with backup plans, and the show-caller communication chain is clear"
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
          "Some MC script language, while appropriate, occasionally feels slightly formulaic - phrases like 'profoundly grateful,' 'truly honored,' and 'invaluable support' appear multiple times and could benefit from more varied vocabulary to maintain freshness across the 2-hour event",
          "The at-a-glance volunteer summary, while helpful, could be even more concise - some volunteers may find the detail level still overwhelming; a true 'cheat sheet' version with just times, locations, and 3-4 bullet points might be useful as an additional tier",
          "Minor timing concern: the 10-minute pledge card completion segment (7:55-8:05) may be tight for 600 guests at 60 tables to have meaningful conversations with table captains and complete cards; 12-15 minutes might be more realistic for this audience size and ask level"

This morning, I wake up to gratitude. Six hundred of you have chosen to be here\u2014before the sun has fully risen\u2014because you believe, as I do, that hunger has no place in the Bay Area.  \n>\n> Today, we gather to support Baywide Food Bank's most ambitious expansion yet: home delivery for our homebound neighbors\u2014seniors, disabled friends, those who cannot reach a distribution site.

Seniors like Yuki (our next speaker) cannot access traditional distribution sites.  \n2. **Our solution (3 min):** Baywide's Home Delivery Expansion: nutritious groceries delivered to doorsteps twice monthly. Not charity\u2014dignity. Client choice. Culturally appropriate foods.  \n3. **What we need (2 min):** Fleet of 10 refrigerated delivery vans. Volunteer driver training. Routing technology. **Cost:** $750,000 to launch; $1.2M/year to sustain.  \n4. **The ask (1 min):** \"This morning, you will have two opportunities to invest: Table Captain pledges and our Paddle Raise.

The bus stop is four blocks away\u2014a journey that, for Yuki, feels like miles. For two years, Yuki went without fresh vegetables.

Life before home delivery: isolation, canned soup, worry  \n2. First delivery: surprise, gratitude, fresh bok choy (\"I cried\")  \n3. Relationship with volunteer driver (Tom\u00e1s): monthly visits, someone who cares  \n4. What it means: independence, dignity, hope  \n5. Thank-you to donors: \"You gave me more than food. You gave me my life back.\"\n\n**If Over Time:** Nina (seated front row, aisle seat) will make gentle eye contact and smile. Yuki knows to wrap naturally.

Samir's MC voice is warm but professional. Gratitude is genuine but tight (avoid long thank-you lists). Testimonials (Yuki, Angela) are given space to breathe\u2014these are the emotional heart.\n\n### Avoiding Clich\u00e9s\n- No \"without further ado\"  \n- No \"I'm humbled\" (unless genuinely true)  \n- No long bios (introduce speakers with role + one human detail)  \n- No rushed \"we're running late\" energy (Clarissa manages cuts invisibly)\n\n### Respecting Clients, Donors, Volunteers\n- Yuki is not \"charity case\"\u2014she is expert on her own life. Treat her testimony as authoritative.  \n- Donors are partners, not ATMs. Paddle Raise is joyful, not pressured.  \n- Volunteers are honored by name (Table Captains stand and are applauded).  \n- Staff work is invisible to guests (smooth execution = respect for everyone's time).\n\n### Equity & Accessibility\n- ASL and captions are not \"accommodations\"\u2014they are standard.  \n- Land Acknowledgment is not performative\u2014it is researched and approved by Ohlone representatives.  \n- Dietary needs are anticipated (not last-minute scrambles).  \n- Quiet room is normalized (signage, staffing, no stigma).\n\n---\n\n## AUTHOR CREDITS\n\n**Master of Ceremonies:** Samir Patel, Morning Show Host, KQSF  \n**Show-Caller:** Clarissa Yoon, Development Director, Baywide Food Bank  \n**Event Producer:** Nina Kapoor, Special Events Manager, Baywide Food Bank\n\n**Run-of-Show Document Prepared By:** Nina Kapoor, in collaboration with Clarissa Yoon, Marcus Chen (AV), and Jordan Lee (Stage Manager)  \n**Date Finalized:** February 20, 2026  \n**Distribution Date:** March 1, 2026\n\n---\n\n**Questions?**  \nContact Nina Kapoor: nina@baywidefoodbank.org | (415) 555-0101\n\n---\n\n*End of Run-of-Show Script*",

        "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally comprehensive and professional run-of-show script that demonstrates deep understanding of nonprofit event production. It perfectly balances formal tone with human warmth, includes every requested element with remarkable detail, and would be immediately usable by event professionals. Minor deductions only for slight over-engineering in places and a few assumptions about technology.",
        "strengths": [
          "Exceptional completeness - every single prompt requirement is addressed with professional-grade detail (minute-by-minute timing, AV cues, contingencies, accessibility, staffing grid, pronunciation guide, etc.)",
          "Perfect tone calibration - maintains formal/polished voice throughout while avoiding stuffiness; MC scripts sound natural and broadcast-professional, not robotic",
          "Outstanding practical usefulness - includes critical operational details often missing from templates (catering clash prevention, buffer windows with specific cut strategies, real-time decision trees, communication protocols)",
          "Sophisticated accessibility integration - ASL, captions, mobility, sensory accommodations are woven throughout as standard practice, not afterthoughts, with specific operator names and backup plans",
          "Authentic nonprofit sector knowledge - demonstrates understanding of donor psychology (paddle raise pacing, confidential pledge cards), client dignity (Yuki treated as expert, not charity case), and volunteer stewardship",
          "Excellent contingency planning - realistic scenarios with clear decision-makers and actionable backup plans (late speakers, tech failures, timing variances)",
          "Thoughtful equity considerations - Land Acknowledgment with pronunciation and consultation notes, cultural competency in client testimonial handling, dietary accommodations pre-registered",
          "Professional production values - AV/tech sheet is venue-ready with channel assignments, file names, GO cues, and show-caller communication protocols that reflect industry standards",
          "Smart buffer management - 14 minutes (15.5%) built in with explicit strategies for deployment, not just vague 'add time here'",
          "Usable deliverables - the At-a-Glance summary and pocket timeline card are genuinely practical tools volunteers would carry and reference"
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
          "Slight over-specification in places - some AV cues (e.g., exact fade timings, lighting percentages) assume more technical control than many nonprofit events have; could note 'if venue allows' for advanced lighting looks",
          "Technology assumptions - references specific software (Givebutter, Otter.ai, Ableton Live) without noting these are examples; some orgs may use different platforms",
          "Minor redundancy - some information (like hard stop time, contact numbers) repeated across sections; while helpful for reference, could be streamlined slightly for a truly final document",
          "Paddle raise script could acknowledge variance - the sample script is excellent but very optimistic (assumes strong response at each level); could include a brief note on how to handle slow levels or pivot strategy"

        "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally thorough, professional run-of-show that demonstrates deep understanding of event production and nonprofit fundraising mechanics. It balances formality with humanity, provides actionable detail at every level, and anticipates real operational challenges. Minor deductions for slight repetition and a few placeholder elements that would need customization.",
        "strengths": [
          "Outstanding completeness: delivers every requested element including minute-by-minute timeline, buffer strategy, AV tech sheet, staffing grid, contingencies, accessibility accommodations, pronunciation guide, and both detailed and at-a-glance formats",
          "Tone is pitch-perfect for formal donor breakfast: MC scripts are polished, broadcast-quality, and respectful without being stiff; avoids clich\u00e9s while maintaining warmth appropriate to the mission",
          "Fund-a-Need mechanics are exceptionally detailed and actionable: specific paddle-raise cadence, spotter protocols, match reveal timing, tally procedures, and donor acknowledgment guidelines that protect anonymity while building momentum",
          "Buffer strategy is explicit and intelligent: three named buffers totaling 17 minutes with clear instructions on when and how to deploy them, maintaining the hard stop while allowing flexibility",
          "Accessibility integration is exemplary: ASL, CART captions, quiet room, wheelchair access, and dietary accommodations are woven throughout rather than treated as afterthought",
          "Catering/service cues prevent common errors: explicit HOLD periods during critical moments (CEO, client, Fund-a-Need) show understanding of how noise disrupts donor focus",
          "Contingency plans are realistic and decision-ready: late speakers, tech failures, weather, and time variances all have named decision-makers and specific workarounds",
          "Speaker guides include cut lines and time signals: shows respect for speakers while protecting program flow",
          "AV/Tech sheet is production-ready: channel assignments, file names with timestamps, lighting looks, and GO calls give the show-caller everything needed to execute",
          "Staffing grid with call times and radio channels demonstrates operational maturity; primary comms plan with backup is essential for 600-person event",
          "MC scripts hit the 60-120 word target and sound natural, not read-y: 'Let's take a breath\u2014and move forward together' is authentic and calming before a big ask",
          "Land acknowledgment is integrated respectfully in context rather than performative",
          "At-a-Glance and printable timeline fulfill the volunteer-friendly summary requirement",
          "Pronunciation guide includes the indigenous land acknowledgment name, showing cultural care"
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
          "Minor inconsistency in author credits: header lists 'MC Clarissa Yoon; Show-Caller Clarissa Yoon' but scenario specifies MC is Samir Patel and show-caller is Clarissa Yoon\u2014appears the AI conflated roles or misread the scenario",
          "Some placeholder language remains ('555-' phone numbers, 'replace with final numbers') which is appropriate for a template but could be flagged more clearly as 'FILL IN'",
          "A few sections repeat information (e.g., accessibility notes appear in timeline, then compiled again; MC scripts appear in timeline then referenced in 'compiled reference')\u2014while thorough, a working document might consolidate to reduce page count",
          "The 'Notes for respect and efficiency' section at the end feels slightly tacked-on; those principles are already embedded throughout and the repetition weakens impact"
