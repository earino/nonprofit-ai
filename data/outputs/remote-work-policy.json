      "content": "## Rio Grande Mobile Food Collaborative Remote Work Policy\n\n**Policy WARM: FORMAL (policy/legal, board-facing)**\n\n**Date Issued:** January 2, 2025\n**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025\n**Revision Date:** January 2, 2025\n\n### 1. Purpose & Scope\n\nThe Rio Grande Mobile Food Collaborative (RGMFC) is committed to improving food security across the Rio Grande region. This Remote Work Policy outlines the terms and conditions for employees approved to work remotely or in a hybrid capacity, balancing operational flexibility with the critical demands of program delivery, equitable treatment of all staff, and the rigorous protection of donor and client confidentiality. This policy applies to all RGMFC employees and is subject to legal review to ensure compliance with all federal, state (New Mexico), and local labor laws.\n\nOur mission-aligned rationale for enabling remote work is to attract and retain talented staff who can effectively support our community, even if their physical presence isn't required daily. By strategically integrating remote roles, we aim to enhance operational efficiency, reduce overhead costs, and foster a more inclusive and diverse workforce.\n\n**Board-Facing Metrics for Policy Success:**\n* Monthly boxes delivered\n* Average client intake turnaround time\n* Donor retention rate\n* Fuel and route optimization cost savings\n* Staff retention and vacancy days\n\n### 2. Definitions\n\n*   **Remote Work:** Performing job duties primarily from an approved off-site location (e.g., home office), with limited or no regular in-office presence.\n*   **Hybrid Work:** A combination of scheduled in-office and remote workdays.\n*   **In-Office Work:** Performing job duties exclusively from RGMFC's physical office or designated field locations.\n\n### 3. Eligibility by Role\n\nEligibility for remote or hybrid work is determined by the essential functions of the role and its impact on RGMFC\u2019s mission.\n\n**Eligible for Remote/Hybrid Work:**\n\n*   **Development Associate:** Remote. Requires focused administrative and communication tasks for fundraising.\n*   **Grants & Reporting Manager:** Remote. Critical for detailed grant writing and compliance; minimal physical presence required.\n*   **Finance and Admin Coordinator:** Hybrid (flexible in-office presence as needed for physical mail, bank deposits). Ensures financial oversight and general administrative support.\n*   **Remote Client Intake Specialist:** Remote. Direct client interaction via phone/digital channels; no in-person requirements.\n*   **Communications Coordinator:** Remote. Manages digital outreach and content creation.\n*   **Volunteer Coordinator:** Hybrid. Requires in-person presence for volunteer training, orientation, and event support, balanced with remote administrative tasks.\n\n**Not Eligible for Remote/Hybrid Work (On-site required due to direct program delivery and physical logistics):**\n\n*   **Route Drivers:** On-site. Essential for food transportation and direct delivery to distribution sites.\n*   **Warehouse Coordinator:** On-site. Manages physical inventory, logistics, and warehouse operations.\n*   **Food Safety Lead:** On-site. Oversees physical food handling, storage, and safety protocols at our facility and in the field.\n*   **Mobile Distribution Site Leads:** On-site. Direct client interaction and on-the-ground management of distribution events.\n*   **Cold Storage Technician:** On-site (as needed for maintenance). Ensures proper functioning of refrigeration units critical for food preservation.\n\n### 4. Work Schedules & Core Hours\n\nAll employees are expected to maintain professional and consistent work schedules.\n\n*   **Core Hours:** 10:00 AM \u2013 3:00 PM Mountain Time (MT), Monday \u2013 Friday. All staff are expected to be available and responsive during these hours.\n*   **Availability Norms:**\n    *   Response to internal communications: Within 4 business hours during core hours.\n    *   Response to external communications: By next business day after 3:00 PM MT.\n*   **Meeting Cadence (Mandatory Attendance):**\n    *   Daily 15-minute stand-up (via Zoom): Tuesday \u2013 Friday mornings.\n    *   Monday 60-minute Program Huddle (via Zoom): Early Monday morning.\n    *   Monthly 90-minute All-Staff Meeting (via Zoom): First Wednesday of each month.\n    *   Biweekly 1:1 Check-ins (via Zoom) with supervisor: Scheduled individually.\n*   **Camera Expectations:**\n    *   Camera on for all 1:1 meetings and funder/client-facing meetings, when bandwidth allows for a stable connection.\n    *   Optional for daily stand-ups and internal team meetings where visual presence is not essential.\n    *   Camera off when driving or in environments where safety or privacy cannot be assured.\n\n### 5. Communication & Meetings\n\nEffective communication is paramount for remote teams. RGMFC utilizes the following tools and norms:\n\n*   **Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs/Sheets):** Primary platform for official email communications and collaborative document creation/storage. Use for all formal internal announcements, project documentation, and external correspondence unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Slack (free tier):** For quick internal chat, informal team discussions, and rapid information sharing. Not for sensitive client or donor data.\n*   **Zoom Pro:** Used for all virtual meetings, including internal team meetings, donor calls, and client consultations. Ensure a professional background and minimize distractions.\n*   **Asana (free tier):** For task tracking, project management, and assigning responsibilities. All project-based tasks should be logged here.\n*   **Airtable:** Primary database for inventory management and comprehensive client intake logs. All client and inventory data entry must occur here.\n*   **Square:** For point-of-sale donations at events. Remote staff may assist with reporting but not direct payment processing.\n*   **OpenVPN:** REQUIRED for secure access to the Airtable database containing donor and client data. Always connect via VPN when accessing sensitive information.\n\n**Documentation Norms:**\n*   All decisions impacting program delivery, financial records, or client services must be documented in Google Docs or Asana with clear actions and owners.\n*   Client and donor records must be meticulously maintained in Airtable, ensuring accuracy and adherence to confidentiality protocols.\n\n### 6. Technology & Security\n\nMaintaining the security and integrity of RGMFC's data is non-negotiable, especially with sensitive client and donor information.\n\n*   **Devices:**\n    *   RGMFC provides a Chromebook, a basic USB headset, and a mobile hotspot (as available) for remote-eligible roles that require them. These remain RGMFC property.\n    *   Employees are permitted to use their personal mobile phones (BYOD - Bring Your Own Device) for work communication, provided the device has a screen lock enabled with a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition.\n    *   Printing of RGMFC documents, especially those containing client or donor data, is strictly prohibited at home. All printing must occur at the RGMFC office using secure printers.\n*   **MFA/VPN:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for all RGMFC accounts. OpenVPN use is mandatory when accessing sensitive data (e.g., Airtable).\n*   **Data Handling (Donors/Clients):**\n    *   No RGMFC data, particularly donor or client information, shall be stored on personal devices or unsecured cloud services.\n    *   All sensitive information must be accessed and stored only through RGMFC-provided and secured platforms (e.g., Google Drive, Airtable via OpenVPN).\n*   **Compliance:** All remote work must comply with:\n    *   PCI DSS SAQ-A for online donations (secure handling of cardholder data).\n    *   USDA/TEFAP client data guidelines (privacy and proper use of program recipient data).\n    *   IRS 501(c)(3) recordkeeping requirements.\n    *   New Mexico Data Breach Notification Act.\n*   **IT Support:**\n    *   RGMFC engages a part-time IT vendor for technical support.\n    *   Submit all IT requests via email to help@riograndemfc.org.\n    *   **Response Times:**\n        *   First response to non-critical tickets: Within 1 business day.\n        *   Critical outages (e.g., inability to access core systems): Within 4 hours.\n        *   Loaner devices (if primary device fails): Available within 2 business days.\n    *   **Incident Reporting:** Employees must immediately report any suspected security breaches, data loss, or unauthorized access to help@riograndemfc.org and their supervisor.\n\n### 7. Workspace & Ergonomics\n\nEmployees are responsible for establishing a safe and ergonomic remote workspace.\n\n*   **Safety Checklist:** Employees must complete an RGMFC-provided home office safety checklist annually.\n*   **Stipend/Cap:**\n    *   A one-time home office setup stipend of up to $250 is available for eligible remote employees to assist with ergonomic essentials (e.g., office chair, desk). Receipts must be submitted.\n    *   A $20/month internet stipend is provided to remote employees.\n    *   A $35/month mobile BYOD stipend may be provided to roles requiring significant field coordination (e.g., Volunteer Coordinator) to offset personal phone use for work.\n*   **ADA Accommodation:** RGMFC is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. Employees requiring accommodation should contact the Director of Operations & HR to initiate the interactive process.\n\n### 8. Performance & Accountability\n\nRemote employees are held to the same performance standards as in-office staff. Emphasis is placed on measurable outputs and clear communication.\n\n*   **Outputs-Based KPIs:** Employee performance will be evaluated based on the achievement of specific, measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), where applicable, such as:\n    *   Food boxes delivered per week (target 1,200 for program team).\n    *   Client intake data entered within 2 business days (achieving \u226595% compliance).\n    *   Donor thank-you sent within 48 hours (achieving \u226595% compliance).\n    *   Average partner inquiry response time under 4 business hours.\n    *   Vehicle cost per box under $0.85 (for logistics roles).\n*   **Check-ins:** Regular 1:1 meetings with supervisors are essential to review progress, provide feedback, and align on priorities.\n*   **Timekeeping & Overtime:** Non-exempt employees must accurately record all hours worked using RGMFC's approved timekeeping system. All overtime must be pre-approved by a supervisor in writing, in accordance with New Mexico and federal labor laws. Exempt employees are expected to manage their time to fulfill their job responsibilities.\n*   **Consequences:** Performance issues, whether for remote or in-office staff, will be addressed consistently in accordance with RGMFC's disciplinary policy.\n\n### 9. Equity & Accessibility\n\nRGMFC is committed to applying this policy fairly and consistently.\n\n*   **Consistent Criteria:** Eligibility for remote work is based solely on job function and operational need, not on individual preferences or perceived tenure.\n*   **Geographic Pay Policy:** A single statewide pay scale applies to all RGMFC roles, regardless of an employee's location within New Mexico. No geographic differentials will be applied. Remote work outside of New Mexico is not permitted without explicit written approval from RGMFC's Board of Directors.\n*   **Fairness:** This policy applies equally to all eligible full-time and part-time staff. Flexible arrangements are considered for volunteer coordination roles to balance administrative and in-person duties equitably.\n\n### 10. Expenses & Equipment\n\n*   RGMFC will provide essential equipment as specified in Section 6.\n*   Reimbursement for approved work-related expenses (e.g., travel for RGMFC meetings, specific software licenses) must follow RGMFC's expense reimbursement policy and require prior supervisor approval. Submit expense reports with receipts via the approved financial system.\n\n### 11. Office Use / Travel\n\n*   Remote employees are welcome to use the RGMFC office when in the area, provided space is available and scheduled in advance with the Finance and Admin Coordinator.\n*   Travel to the main RGMFC office for mandatory meetings (e.g., quarterly all-staff gatherings) will be reimbursed for mileage/transportation in accordance with our travel policy.\n*   Travel for program delivery or development activities will be reimbursed per policy.\n\n### 12. Implementation\n\n*   **Effective Date:** This policy becomes effective on January 15, 2025.\n*   **Trial Period:** A 90-day trial period will commence from the effective date to assess the policy's effectiveness and address initial challenges.\n*   **Annual Review:** This policy will be formally reviewed annually in July by the Director of Operations & HR and the Governance & HR Committee of the Board, with potential revisions made based on feedback, operational needs, technology changes, and legal updates.\n*   **Exceptions:** Any exceptions to this policy must be submitted in writing and approved by the Executive Director.\n\n### 13. Compliance & Acknowledgment\n\nAll employees are required to read, understand, and comply with this Remote Work Policy. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n**Employee Acknowledgment:**\n\nI, [Employee Name], acknowledge that I have read, understood, and agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the Rio Grande Mobile Food Collaborative Remote Work Policy. I understand that this policy may be updated periodically, and I am responsible for familiarizing myself with any revisions. I also understand that this policy does not create an express or implied contract of employment and that RGMFC maintains an at-will employment relationship.\n\n_______________________________________\nEmployee Signature\n\n_______________________________________\nPrinted Name\n\n_______________________________________\nDate\n\n### 14.

We believe that intentional and well-supported remote work can enhance employee well-being, optimize operational efficiency, and further our mission to improve air quality for all. This policy aims to balance the flexibility and autonomy of our team with the critical needs of program delivery, equitable treatment of all staff, and the utmost protection of donor and client confidentiality.\n\n**Mission Alignment Rationale:** By embracing flexible work where appropriate, we can attract and retain top talent across Chicagoland and surrounding areas, reduce our carbon footprint from commuting, and strategically allocate resources to our core programs. This policy supports our commitment to a healthier environment, even within our own operations.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Purpose & Scope (FORMAL)\n\nThis policy establishes guidelines for remote and hybrid work arrangements for all eligible employees of the Chicago Alliance for Clean Air. Its purpose is to ensure clear expectations, consistent application, and equitable support for flexible work, while maintaining high standards of program effectiveness, data security, and confidentiality, and adhering to all applicable labor laws. This policy applies to all CACA employees, regardless of full-time or part-time status.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Definitions (WARM)\n\nTo make sure we're all on the same page, here are some key terms:\n\n*   **Remote Work:** An approved arrangement where an employee consistently performs their primary job duties from a location other than CACA\u2019s main office, typically their home.\n*   **Hybrid Work:** An approved arrangement blending in-office and remote work, where an employee regularly works from the CACA office for a portion of their workweek and remotely for the remainder.\n*   **In-Office Work:** An arrangement where an employee performs their primary job duties exclusively from CACA\u2019s main office.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Eligibility by Role (CASUAL)\n\nNot all roles at CACA can be performed remotely due to their nature and our mission-critical work. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Roles Generally Eligible for Remote or Hybrid Work:**\n\n*   Policy Analysts\n*   Grant Writer and Development Operations\n*   Communications Team\n*   Data Analyst\n*   HR and Finance Staff\n*   Program Managers (non-field days)\n*   Education Coordinators (non-school days)\n\n**Why they're eligible:** These roles primarily involve desk-based work, data analysis, writing, communication, and strategic planning, which can often be effectively performed outside the physical office without compromising core program delivery or constituent interaction.\n\n**Roles Requiring Primarily In-Office/On-site Presence:**\n\n*   Field Technicians operating air monitors\n*   Community Organizers during canvassing/field days\n*   Laboratory Manager and Lab Assistants\n*   Facilities & Mailroom Associate\n*   Front Desk/Office Receptionist\n\n**Why they're on-site:** These positions require direct physical presence to operate equipment, engage face-to-face with communities, manage physical assets, or provide direct facilities support. Their physical presence is integral to CACA\u2019s mission and daily operations. Field Technicians and Community Organizers, while often out of the office, require in-person interaction with monitors or community members, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Work Schedules & Core Hours (WARM)\n\nWe value flexibility, but also need to ensure collaboration and availability.\n\n*   **Core Hours:** Our standard operating hours for collaboration and essential meetings are **9:30 AM \u2013 4:00 PM Central Time (CT)**, Monday through Friday. All eligible employees are expected to be generally available during these hours.\n*   **Availability Norms:**\n    *   **Slack:** Expect a response within **2 business hours** during core hours.\n    *   **Email:** Expect a response within **1 business day**.\n    *   **Team Standups:** Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 9:30 AM \u2013 9:45 AM CT.\n    *   **All-Staff Meetings:** Every other Thursday, 11:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM CT.\n    *   **Quarterly Retreat:** One in-person all-staff retreat per quarter (full day).\n    *   **1:1s (Manager-Employee):** Weekly for the first 90 days of employment or a new role, then bi-weekly thereafter.\n*   **Camera Expectations:**\n    *   **Required:** Camera on for external partner/funder meetings and performance check-ins.\n    *   **Optional:** For internal standups and large internal meetings. We encourage cameras for better connection but respect individual bandwidth and privacy needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Communication & Meetings (CASUAL)\n\nClear communication is key to our success, whether remote or in-office. Here\u2019s how we'll connect:\n\n*   **Communication Tools:**\n    *   **Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive):** Our primary suite for email, chat, team collaboration, and document storage. Use Teams for internal discussions and quick queries.\n    *   **Zoom Pro:** For external webinars, large events, and pre-scheduled external meetings.\n    *   **Asana Premium:** For project management, task tracking, and team workflows. Use this for all project-related communications.\n    *   **Salesforce NPSP:** Our official system for donor and constituent relationship management. All donor/client interactions and key communications must be logged here.\n    *   **ArcGIS Online:** For mapping and integration with sensor data.\n    *   **LastPass Enterprise:** Secure password management for shared accounts.\n    *   **Azure VPN:** For secure remote access to internal network resources.\n*   **Documentation Norms:** Critical decisions, client agreements, donor communications, and external meeting notes must be documented in the appropriate system (Salesforce, SharePoint, Asana) within one business day. This ensures continuity, transparency, and compliance.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Technology & Security (FORMAL)\n\nProtecting our data, especially sensitive donor and client information, is paramount.\n\n*   **Devices:**\n    *   **Primary Work Device:** CACA-issued encrypted Windows laptop with an integrated webcam. This is your primary tool for all work-related tasks.\n    *   **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):** Personal mobile phones are permitted for work email access only after installing our Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to ensure data security.\n    *   **Peripherals:** External monitor and keyboard/mouse are available upon request to enhance ergonomics.\n    *   **Internet Access:** Staff whose roles require off-site coordination or field work will be provided with mobile hotspots when needed.\n*   **Security Protocols:**\n    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Required for all CACA accounts.\n    *   **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Required for accessing internal network resources from outside the CACA office.\n    *   **LastPass Enterprise:** Mandatory usage for managing and sharing passwords securely.\n*   **Data Handling & Confidentiality:**\n    *   All donor/client data must be handled in strict accordance with CACA\u2019s Data Privacy Policy. No sensitive data is to be stored on personal devices or insecure cloud services.\n    *   **Illinois Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA):** All staff must adhere to PIPA requirements regarding the protection of personal information.\n    *   **PCI DSS SAQ-A:** All payment processing activities must comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Self-Assessment Questionnaire A.\n    *   **EPA Grant Data Stewardship:** Data collected under EPA grants must adhere to specific stewardship terms outlined in grant agreements.\n    *   **IRS 501(c)(3) Recordkeeping:** All financial and operational records must comply with IRS recordkeeping requirements for non-profit organizations.\n*   **IT Support:**\n    *   **Team:** Our in-house IT Specialist, supported by a Managed Service Provider (MSP).\n    *   **Helpdesk:** Submit support requests via our Jira helpdesk portal.\n    *   **Response Times (8:00 AM \u2013 6:00 PM CT):**\n        *   **Standard Requests:** First response within 2 hours.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1) Outages (critical system down):** Response within 1 hour.\n    *   **Hardware Replacement:**\n        *   Within Chicago metro: 3 business days.\n        *   Elsewhere: 5 business days, subject to shipping availability.\n    *   **Incident Reporting:** All suspected security incidents or data breaches must be reported immediately to the IT Specialist.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Workspace & Ergonomics (WARM)\n\nYour health and safety matter, even when working remotely.\n\n*   **Safety Checklist:** All remote/hybrid employees must complete a home workspace safety checklist to confirm their setup meets basic safety standards.\n*   **Home Office Setup Support:**\n    *   We offer a one-time stipendium of **$300** for eligible employees to purchase home office equipment (e.g., proper chair, desk accessories). Receipts are required for reimbursement.\n    *   **Internet Stipend:** For full-time remote employees, we offer a **$30/month** internet stipend.\n    *   **Mobile Phone Stipend:** For roles requiring significant off-site coordination, a **$50/month** mobile phone stipend (for BYOD) is available.\n*   **ADA Accommodations:** CACA is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Employees needing accommodations should contact the People & Culture Manager to initiate the interactive process.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Performance & Accountability (CASUAL)\n\nOur focus is on results, not just hours logged.\n\n*   **Performance Metrics (KPIs):** We'll evaluate performance based on agreed-upon outputs and outcomes. Examples include:\n    *   Air sensor uptime: \u226598%\n    *   Policy briefs delivered on schedule: \u226590% on-time\n    *   Average webinar attendance: \u2265150\n    *   Grant submissions: \u22654 per quarter with \u226530% success rate\n    *   Public data request responses: within 5 business days\n*   **Check-ins:** Regular 1:1 meetings with your manager are crucial for discussing progress, challenges, and professional development.\n*   **Timekeeping & Overtime:** All employees must accurately record their work hours in accordance with CACA policy and Illinois labor laws. Non-exempt employees must obtain prior approval from their manager for any overtime hours.\n*   **Consequences:** Performance issues, whether related to output, adherence to policy, or communication, will be addressed consistently and fairly according to CACA's standard progressive discipline policy.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Equity & Accessibility (FORMAL)\n\nFairness and inclusion are fundamental to our values.\n\n*   **Consistent Criteria:** Eligibility for remote/hybrid work and performance evaluations will be applied using consistent, objective criteria across all roles, regardless of race, gender, disability, or other protected characteristics.\n*   **Geographic Pay Policy:** CACA employs a two-zone salary banding structure:\n    *   **Zone A:** Chicago metropolitan area (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will counties).\n    *   **Zone B:** Rest of Illinois and adjacent states (Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky) at -8% of the Zone A salary bands.\n    *   **Temporary Arrangements:** No changes to pay will occur for temporary remote arrangements (e.g., for short-term personal circumstances).\n*   **Fairness for Part-Time & Volunteer Coordination:** This policy extends equitable consideration to part-time staff and ensures that our approach to remote work does not inadvertently disadvantage volunteer coordination efforts or the roles of those who support our crucial volunteer base.\n\n---\n\n### 10. Expenses & Equipment (WARM)\n\nWe'll help cover some costs associated with remote work.\n\n*   CACA will provide the necessary CACA-issued laptop, software, and secure access tools.\n*   Stipends outlined in Section 7 (_Workspace & Ergonomics_) cover recurring costs like internet and mobile phone use for eligible roles.\n*   Any other work-related expenses must be pre-approved by a manager and submitted for reimbursement according to CACA's expense policy.\n\n---\n\n### 11. Office Use & Travel (CASUAL)\n\nOur office remains an important hub.\n\n*   **Office Access:** Even if you're primarily remote, you are welcome to use the CACA office during business hours, space permitting. Please coordinate with your team if you plan to be in routinely.\n*   **Required In-Office Days:** Staff in hybrid roles will have specific days/times they are expected in the office, as agreed upon with their manager.\n*   **Travel:** Any work-related travel, whether to the CACA office or for program activities, must follow CACA\u2019s travel policy and expense guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### 12. Implementation (Trial, Review, Exceptions) (WARM)\n\nWe're launching this with a clear plan for refinement.\n\n*   **Effective Date:** This policy goes into effect on **February 1, 2025**.\n*   **Trial Period:** A 120-day trial period will be observed from the effective date to gather feedback and assess policy effectiveness.\n*   **Annual Review:** This policy will be reviewed annually in **October** by the People & Culture Manager and the Board Governance & Compensation Committee to ensure it remains relevant and effective.\n*   **Exceptions:** Any exceptions to this policy must be submitted in writing to the Chief Operating Officer for review and approval.\n\n---\n\n### 13. Compliance & Acknowledgment (FORMAL)\n\nYour understanding and agreement are important.\n\nAll employees are required to read, understand, and adhere to this Remote Work Policy. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. This policy is subject to legal review and may be updated periodically.\n\n**Employee Acknowledgment:**\n\n---\n\n\"I have read, understood, and agree to abide by the Chicago Alliance for Clean Air Remote Work Policy.

PURPOSE & SCOPE\n\nChicago Alliance for Clean Air fights for healthy air in communities across Illinois through science, policy advocacy, and community organizing. This Remote Work Policy supports our mission by letting staff work where they're most effective\u2014while protecting program quality, donor trust, and equitable access to flexibility.\n\n**This policy applies to all regular employees (full-time and part-time).** Temporary staff, interns, and contractors follow separate agreements. Nothing here changes at-will employment or overrides federal/state/local law. **This policy is subject to legal review and may be updated at any time.**\n\n**Why we're doing this:** Remote options expand our talent pool, cut overhead (helping us direct more resources to programs), reduce commute emissions, and improve retention.

      "content": "# SAFE HARBOR NORTHWEST\n## REMOTE WORK POLICY\n\n**Effective Date:** March 1, 2025  \n**Revision Date:** February 10, 2025  \n**Issued by:** Director of Compliance & Employee Relations  \n**Approved by:** Board HR & Program Oversight Committee  \n**Subject to legal review**\n\n---\n\n## 1. PURPOSE & SCOPE\n\nSafe Harbor Northwest exists to provide safety, advocacy, legal services, and healing to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. This policy establishes when and how employees may work remotely while maintaining our capacity to deliver mission-critical services, protect confidentiality, honor donor trust, and ensure equitable access to flexibility.\n\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, and volunteers performing work on behalf of Safe Harbor Northwest. Remote work is a privilege, not an entitlement, and may be modified or revoked based on program needs, performance, or funding requirements. This policy does not alter at-will employment status.\n\n**Mission rationale:** Flexible work supports recruitment and retention in the nonprofit sector while reducing real estate costs. However, our commitment to survivors requires many roles to be physically present to deliver safe, confidential, trauma-informed services.\n\n---\n\n## 2. DEFINITIONS\n\n**Remote:** Employee performs all work from an approved off-site location; attends office/program site only for scheduled meetings, training, or events.\n\n**Hybrid:** Employee splits time between approved remote location and office/program site on a defined schedule (e.g., 3 days on-site, 2 remote).\n\n**In-Office:** Employee works exclusively from Safe Harbor facilities during all scheduled shifts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. ELIGIBILITY BY ROLE\n\n### **A. Roles Eligible for Remote or Hybrid Work**\n\n- **Finance, HR, and IT Staff:** Hybrid or remote eligible. Finance and HR must be on-site during audit periods, board meetings, and benefits open enrollment (typically 8\u201312 days/year).\n- **Development and Major Gifts Team:** Hybrid eligible. On-site required for donor events, new major donor cultivation meetings, and annual gala preparation (typically 15\u201320 days/year).\n- **Grants and Compliance:** Remote eligible. On-site required for site visits by funders (DOJ, OVW, state agencies) and grant kick-off meetings (typically 6\u201310 days/year).\n- **Data & Evaluation Analysts:** Remote eligible. On-site required for quarterly data review with program staff and annual outcomes reporting sessions (typically 8 days/year).\n- **Hotline Advocates (post-training, secure environment):** Hybrid eligible after completing 90-day on-site training and demonstrating secure home workspace with lockable storage, dedicated phone line, and privacy from household members. On-site shifts required for new staff shadowing and quarterly drills.\n- **Legal Program Remote Intake (non-court days):** Hybrid eligible for intake, research, and document preparation. On-site required for all court appearances, client in-person meetings, protection order filings, and collaboration with forensic interviewers.\n- **Training & Prevention (curriculum development days):** Hybrid eligible for curriculum writing and virtual community trainings. On-site required for school-based programs, in-person workshops, and coalition meetings.\n- **Clinical Supervisors for documentation/admin days:** Hybrid eligible for supervision notes, treatment planning, and continuing education. On-site required for client sessions, crisis response, and staff clinical consultation.\n\n### **B. Roles Requiring In-Office/On-Site Work**\n\n- **Shelter Advocates and Managers while on shift:** Survivors require physical presence for safety, children's activities, crisis intervention, and meal support. On-site 100% of scheduled shifts.\n- **Shelter Intake/Front Desk:** Physical screening, key distribution, emergency supplies, and visitor management require on-site presence 100% of shifts.\n- **Facilities and Maintenance:** Building security, repairs, safety inspections, and emergency response require on-site presence. Remote work not applicable.\n- **On-site Childcare Staff:** Licensing, supervision ratios, and child safety require physical presence 100% of shifts.\n- **On-site Clinicians during client hours:** HIPAA-compliant telehealth from organizational location or client homes is permitted; personal residence not approved for client sessions unless separate entrance and soundproofed office (rare exception).\n- **Forensic Nurse Examiners:** Evidence collection, chain of custody, and trauma-informed physical exams require hospital or clinic presence 100% of shifts.\n- **Court Accompaniment when court is in person:** Physical presence required to support survivors during hearings, restraining order filings, and trial testimony.\n- **Donation Center Staff:** Receiving, sorting, tagging, and distributing donated goods require on-site presence 100% of shifts.\n\n**Rationale:** Survivor safety, confidentiality, compliance with licensing and grant conditions, and trauma-informed care take precedence over flexibility.\n\n---\n\n## 4. WORK SCHEDULES & CORE HOURS\n\n- **Core hours:** 9:00 AM\u20135:00 PM Pacific Time (PT), Monday\u2013Friday, unless shift-based role.\n- Employees must be available, responsive, and working during core hours.\n- Flexible start/end times outside core hours require supervisor approval and must not interfere with client services or team collaboration.\n- Shift-based roles (shelter, hotline, childcare) follow posted schedules.

Suspension of remote work privilege (return to on-site).\n4. Termination (consistent with at-will employment and organizational discipline policy).\n\n---\n\n## 9. EQUITY & ACCESSIBILITY\n\n### **A. Consistent Criteria**\n\nRemote work eligibility is based on role requirements, not tenure, title, or personal preference. All decisions documented with mission/program rationale (see Section 3).\n\n### **B. Geographic Pay Policy**\n\nSafe Harbor uses a three-zone pay structure to balance cost of living with pay equity:\n\n- **Zone 1 (Seattle metro: King, Snohomish, Pierce counties):** Base salary scale.\n- **Zone 2 (Other WA urban: Spokane, Tacoma, Vancouver, Bellingham, Olympia):** Base -7%.\n- **Zone 3 (Rural WA):** Base -12%.\n- **National remote:** Generally not permitted; requires Board approval and legal review of nexus, benefits, and tax implications.\n\nPay zones apply to new hires and employees who relocate. Employees moving from higher to lower zone receive 12-month salary protection, then adjusted at next annual increase.\n\n### **C. Annual Pay Equity Review**\n\nHR and Finance conduct annual analysis (January) comparing remote vs. on-site compensation for similar roles, controlling for experience and performance. Results reported to Board HR Committee. Adjustments made if unexplained disparities >5%.\n\n### **D. Part-Time and Volunteer Coordination Roles**\n\nPart-time employees (20\u201339 hours/week) eligible for remote work on same terms as full-time. Volunteer coordinators may work hybrid to balance remote recruitment/training with on-site volunteer events.\n\n---\n\n## 10. EXPENSES & EQUIPMENT\n\n### **A. Organization-Provided**\n\n- Encrypted laptop, dock, monitors, headset (standard package \u2248$2,200 value).\n- Lockable file box and crosscut shredder (confidential roles).\n- VPN and MFA licenses.\n- Shipping and IT setup support.\n\n### **B.

Office Access**\n\nAll remote employees retain 24/7 badge access to assigned office/program site for:\n\n- Scheduled meetings, training, or collaboration days.\n- Mail pickup and package delivery.\n- Confidential printing or scanning.\n- Use of dedicated workspace (hot-desking for fully remote staff; assigned desk for hybrid).\n\n**Reservation system:** Remote staff must reserve hot desks via Outlook 24 hours in advance. Hybrid staff have assigned desks but may not block others from use on remote days.\n\n### **B. Required Travel**\n\n- **Quarterly all-staff meetings:** Typically King County site (transportation reimbursed per mileage policy).\n- **Annual retreat:** 2-day program planning and team-building (overnight lodging covered if >50 miles from site).\n- **Funder site visits:** As scheduled (travel pre-approved by supervisor).\n- **Board meetings:** Development and Finance staff attend 2\u20134/year.\n\nTravel reimbursed at IRS mileage rate (2025: $0.70/mile); overnight lodging at GSA per diem or actual cost (receipts required).

Exceptions**\n\nExceptions to eligibility, geographic zones, or equipment provisions require written request to **Chief Human Resources Officer** with rationale and supervisor endorsement. Decisions made within 15 business days; appeals to CEO.\n\nTemporary exceptions (e.g., medical leave, evacuation, family emergency) approved by supervisor for up to 30 days; extended exceptions require CHRO approval.\n\n---\n\n## 13.
