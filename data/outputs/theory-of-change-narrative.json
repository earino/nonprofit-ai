      "content": "Youth Trades Launch, V1.0, 2025-11-02, Aisha Thompson, Program Manager\n\n**Impact Statement:** By 2030, Youth Trades Launch will significantly reduce youth disconnection among Black and Latino youth ages 16\u201324 in Milwaukee\u2019s Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights who are not in school and not working, including youth with prior justice involvement, increasing their participation in family-sustaining employment and contributing to economic stability in these neighborhoods.\n\n**Problem & Root Causes:**\nMilwaukee faces a critical challenge of youth disconnection. Approximately 17% of young people ages 16-24 in Milwaukee are neither attending school nor working, according to the 2023 American Community Survey (Census). This rate is disproportionately higher for Black and Latino youth in neighborhoods like Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights. The 2024 City of Milwaukee Workforce Dashboard highlights persistent disparities in workforce participation among these demographics. While there is a strong demand for skilled trades workers, with over 3,000 construction job postings in Wisconsin in early 2024 (Wisconsin DWD), many local youth lack access to these opportunities. Our 2024 listening sessions with 42 local youth revealed significant barriers: lack of relevant job skills, limited awareness of trades careers, transportation issues, and a history of justice involvement creating hiring obstacles. Root causes include historical disinvestment in these communities, leading to inadequate educational and employment infrastructures. Systemic racism and implicit bias in hiring practices further marginalize Black and Latino youth, especially those with prior justice involvement. Access gaps in quality training programs and social networks needed for trades entry perpetuate this problem locally.\n\n**Pathway of Change:**\n\n*   **Activities:** If Northside Neighbors Collective provides comprehensive outreach, individualized case management, pre-apprenticeship training, paid work-based learning, and job placement support, then\u2026\n    *   **Outputs:** \u2026we will enroll 50 Black and Latino youth ages 16\u201324 annually, with 80% completing the 10-week pre-apprenticeship program (WRTP/BIG STEP) and 75% completing 120 hours of paid work-based learning (Employ Milwaukee). Assumes our outreach effectively connects with target youth and that partner capacity for placements remains stable. Our organizational history of successful community engagement indicates effective recruitment, and current partner MOUs secure these training slots.\n    *   **Short-term Outcomes (6\u201312 months):** If youth complete these activities, then 90% will gain OSHA-10 certification, demonstrate increased knowledge of trades career pathways, and improve soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork) by 25% on a pre/post assessment. Assumes training content is relevant and delivered effectively by partners. WRTP/BIG STEP has a proven curriculum and certified instructors, and Employ Milwaukee\u2019s work-based learning includes structured supervision to develop these skills.\n    *   **Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 years):** If youth gain certifications and improved skills, then 70% will enter full-time registered apprenticeships or entry-level trades employment (IBEW Local 494 and other employers) within 12 months of program completion, and 60% will report sustained employment or apprenticeship enrollment after 18 months. Assumes a strong labor market demand for trades and that employers are willing to hire program graduates, including those with justice involvement. Our deep relationships with union partners like IBEW Local 494 and knowledge of the Milwaukee trades market suggest realistic placement rates, and our tailored supports address hiring barriers.\n    *   **Long-term Outcomes (3\u20135+ years):** If youth secure stable trades employment or apprenticeships, then 75% will achieve an average annual income exceeding 200% of the federal poverty level, and 50% will advance into journey-level positions or leadership roles within their respective trades. Assumes wage growth in the trades sector and consistent opportunities for advancement through apprenticeships. These are standard career progressions within unionized trades, which typically offer strong income and advancement ladders.\n    *   **Impact:** If a significant number of disconnected youth reach long-term economic stability through skilled trades, then youth disconnection rates in Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights will decrease by 5 percentage points, contributing to a more resilient local economy and reduced cycles of poverty. Assumes that our program reaches a critical mass of youth to create measurable community-level change and that other community factors remain stable or improve. This represents a tangible shift in neighborhood economic indicators.\n\n**Preconditions & External Factors:**\nSuccess relies on stable funding for Northside Neighbors Collective\u2019s operations, active Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Employ Milwaukee, WRTP/BIG STEP, and IBEW Local 494, and a safe, accessible program space. These are largely within our control. External factors include the fluctuating demand within Milwaukee\u2019s construction and manufacturing sectors, state and federal policies affecting workforce development funding, and the availability of affordable housing and reliable transportation for program participants. We will monitor local economic indicators and maintain flexibility in program scheduling to mitigate transportation challenges. We also advocate for supportive policy changes at local and state levels.\n\n**Attribution & Partnership:**\nNorthside Neighbors Collective's specific role is to recruit, assess, provide individualized case management, and offer comprehensive job placement support, ensuring youth navigate the pathway to trades effectively. Employ Milwaukee\u2019s role in providing referrals and securing invaluable paid work-based learning slots directly contributes to our activities and outputs, giving youth critical exposure and income. WRTP/BIG STEP delivers the essential pre-apprenticeship training and OSHA-10 certification, directly enabling our short-term outcomes. IBEW Local 494 provides vital jobsite rotations and mentors, which are crucial for intermediate outcome achievement and long-term career progression. The ultimate impact of reduced youth disconnection and increased neighborhood economic stability requires this collective effort, as Northside Neighbors Collective cannot alone create the training capacity or guarantee job placements. Our joint work influences systems by creating a clearer, more accessible pathway into the trades for marginalized youth.\n\n**Risks & Mitigation:**\n*   **Participant Retention:** Youth may drop out due to competing demands (family responsibilities, childcare, transportation, justice system interactions). *Mitigation:* Provide weekly stipends for participation, offer flexible scheduling, provide transportation assistance (bus passes/ride-sharing vouchers), and employ trauma-informed case management linked to community resources.\n*   **Employer Bias:** Employers may hesitate to hire youth with prior justice involvement. *Mitigation:* Work closely with IBEW Local 494 and Employ Milwaukee to educate employers on the benefits of second-chance hiring, highlight youth skills, and provide post-placement support for employers and youth.\n*   **Limited Apprenticeship Slots:** Availability of union apprenticeships may not meet demand. *Mitigation:* Diversify employer partnerships beyond unions (e.g., non-union contractors via Employ Milwaukee) and support youth in exploring related trades that may have more openings.\n*   **Transportation Barriers:** Youth struggle to get to training sites and jobs. *Mitigation:* Fund unlimited bus passes or provide direct transportation support, and identify training/job sites accessible by public transit.\nBeneficiary voice will shape adaptations through monthly check-ins with case managers, anonymous program surveys, and quarterly youth advisory council meetings, ensuring feedback directly informs program design adjustments.\n\n**Learning & Measurement:**\nOur team of 5 staff, operating with limited evaluation resources, will collect and use data systematically.\n*   **Indicators:**\n    *   **Outputs:** # youth enrolled; % completing pre-apprenticeship; % completing paid work-based learning hours.\n    *   **Short-term:** % achieving OSHA-10; % scoring 25% higher on soft skills assessment; % identifying three trades pathways.\n    *   **Intermediate:** % placed into apprenticeships/trades jobs within 12 months; % retained in jobs/apprenticeships at 18 months.\n    *   **Long-term:** % earning 200% FPL at 3 years; % in journey-level roles at 5 years.\n*   **Key Learning Questions:** What are the most significant barriers to consistent participation? Which program components are most effective in securing sustainable employment for justice-involved youth? How can we strengthen employer commitment to hiring program graduates?\n*   **Data Sources:** Program enrollment forms, partner completion reports (WRTP/BIG STEP, Employ Milwaukee), pre/post assessments, participant attendance logs, participant exit interviews, post-placement follow-up surveys, employer feedback forms, wage data (with consent).\n*   **Frequency:** Monthly output reviews by program staff; quarterly outcome checks via surveys and partner reports; annual programmatic deep-dive with all staff; annual partner debrief to review progress and challenges.\n*   **Use:** Findings will inform ongoing program tweaks (e.g., adjusting outreach strategies, refining case management protocols, tailoring job readiness workshops), identify areas for staff training, and be shared with partners (Employ Milwaukee, WRTP/BIG STEP, IBEW Local 494) to collaboratively address systemic barriers and strengthen referral pathways.\n\n**Boundaries & Sustainability:**\nThis program will NOT provide direct housing services or mental health therapy, instead connecting youth to specialized community resources. Core assumptions for financial sustainability include continued philanthropic support and diversified government grants. Operational sustainability relies on maintaining strong partnerships and clear referral processes. For impact to last beyond direct services, Milwaukee's trades industries must continue to evolve inclusive hiring practices, and public policies must support career pathways for marginalized youth, including expanded fair chance legislation.\n\nAisha Thompson, Program Manager, 2025-11-02\n\n**Visual Diagram Outline:**\n\nBox 1: Problem (17% youth disconnection for 16-24 year olds in Milwaukee; higher for Black/Latino youth in Sherman Park/Lindsay Heights; specific barriers: skills gap, limited awareness, justice involvement)\n\u2193\nBox 2: Activities (Outreach, individualized case management, pre-apprenticeship training, paid work-based learning, job placement support)\n\u2193 Yes\u2014Effective outreach; stable partner capacity\nBox 3: Outputs (50 youth enrolled/year; 80% complete pre-apprenticeship; 75% complete 120 hrs paid work-based learning)\n\u2193 Yes\u2014Relevant training content, effective delivery\nBox 4: Short-term (90% achieve OSHA-10; 25% gain in soft skills; increased trades pathway knowledge within 6-12 months)\n\u2193 Yes\u2014Strong trades labor market demand; employers willing to hire diverse youth\nBox 5: Intermediate (70% enter full-time apprenticeships/trades jobs within 12 months; 60% sustained employment/apprenticeship at 18 months)\nMilwaukee trades demand fluctuates (external factor)\n\u2193 Yes\u2014Trades sector wage growth; consistent apprenticeship advancement opportunities\nBox 6: Long-term (75% earn 200% FPL; 50% advance to journey-level/leadership within 3-5+ years)\n\u2193 Yes\u2014Program reaches critical mass; other community factors stable/improving\nBox 7: Impact (5 percentage point decrease in youth disconnection in Sherman Park/Lindsay Heights; resilient local economy)",

      "content": "1) Header & Impact Statement\nYouth Trades Launch Theory of Change \u2014 Northside Neighbors Collective\nV1.0 | 2025-11-02 | Aisha Thompson, Program Manager\n\nImpact statement: Black and Latino youth ages 16\u201324 in Milwaukee\u2019s Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights who are not in school and not working, including youth with prior justice involvement, gain skilled trades jobs and steady earnings within five years, reducing youth disconnection and unemployment in these neighborhoods.\n\n2) Problem & Root Causes (100\u2013150 words)\nMilwaukee has a high share of youth disconnected from school and work. The 2023 American Community Survey shows roughly one in five 16\u201324-year-olds citywide are disconnected, with higher rates for Black and Latino youth and in North Side ZIP codes that include Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights. The 2024 City of Milwaukee Workforce Dashboard shows youth (16\u201319 and 20\u201324) have the highest unemployment rates and the most barriers to re-entry. At the same time, the 2024 Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development postings show steady demand for construction trades, with hundreds of openings in Milwaukee County and starting wages commonly $20\u201326/hour. Our 2024 listening sessions with 42 local youth cited key barriers: lack of credentials and references, transportation, court records, childcare, and few paid \u201con-ramps.\u201d Root causes include structural racism in hiring and training selection, credential and driver\u2019s license requirements that screen out youth, and weak local bridges between neighborhoods and unions or contractors. These factors persist due to fragmented services and limited paid, entry-level training slots.\n\n3) Pathway of Change (250\u2013350 words)\nActivities (what we do)\n- Recruit 50 Black and Latino youth (ages 16\u201324) per year from Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights who are out of school and work; prioritize youth with prior justice involvement.\n- Provide 8 weeks of paid readiness: weekly coaching, soft-skills labs, ID support, and OSHA-10 delivered by WRTP/BIG STEP; stipends of $15/hour for up to 80 hours.\n- Place youth in 6\u20138 week paid work-based learning slots through Employ Milwaukee; provide tools/PPE and bus passes.\n- Rotate interested youth through 2\u20133 union jobsites with IBEW Local 494 mentors; support applications to pre-apprenticeship or entry-level employment.\n- Offer wraparound supports: court navigation, childcare referrals, and driver\u2019s license vouchers; 12 months of follow-up coaching.\n\nOutputs (what we produce)\n- 50 enrolled per year; 90% complete intake and baseline assessments.\n- 45 earn OSHA-10 and complete 80 hours of readiness.\n- 35 start paid work-based learning; 30 complete at least 120 site hours.\n- 30 complete at least two jobsite mentor rotations.\n\nShort-term outcomes (6\u201312 months)\n- If youth complete paid readiness plus OSHA-10, then at least 80% will gain work readiness skills (rubric pre/post) within six months, because paid time, practice, and a recognized safety credential build confidence and employer trust. Assumes consistent attendance and credential acceptance by host sites. Evidence: our last cohorts and national studies find paid work-based learning increases soft skills and placement rates.\n- If youth complete 120+ site hours with weekly coaching, then 70% will secure a job offer or pre-apprenticeship interview within 12 months, because supervisors observe real performance and coaches address barriers in real time. Assumes hosts provide meaningful tasks and feedback. Research on work-based learning shows employer evaluation predicts hiring.\n\nIntermediate outcomes (1\u20133 years)\n- If youth are placed and supported for 12 months, then 60% will retain employment at 6 months and 50% at 12 months, and 30% will enter a registered apprenticeship within 24 months. Assumes steady local demand and continued partner slots. Rationale: DWD data show sustained openings; mentoring improves retention in trades.\n- If partners institutionalize fair-chance screening, then more justice-involved youth will be eligible. Assumes contractor buy-in; we will secure MOUs.\n\nLong-term outcomes (3\u20135+ years)\n- 50% of graduates employed full-time at $20+/hour at 24 months; 40% in union roles or apprenticeships by 36 months. Assumes wage floors track posted rates and completion of probationary periods.\n\nImpact (population-level change)\n- Contribute to a 2\u20133 point reduction in youth disconnection and youth unemployment in Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights over five years. Assumes city labor demand stays stable and referral pipelines scale.\n\n4) Preconditions & External Factors (75\u2013100 words)\nPreconditions: signed MOUs with Employ Milwaukee, WRTP/BIG STEP, and IBEW Local 494; funding for stipends, tools, and bus passes; safe training space; data-sharing agreements; referral pipelines with schools, juvenile justice, and CBOs. Within our control: recruitment, coaching quality, stipends, case management, and scheduling. External: construction cycle, union entry timelines, expungement policies, transit reliability, childcare access. We will monitor DWD postings monthly and the City Workforce Dashboard quarterly, review partner slot commitments monthly, and adjust cohort size, pacing, and trade focus each quarter.\n\n5) Attribution & Partnership (75\u2013100 words)\nNorthside Neighbors Collective recruits, coaches, covers stipends and supports, and tracks outcomes. We can credibly claim outputs, short-term skill gains, and placements we broker. Employ Milwaukee provides referrals and paid work-based learning slots tied to WIOA; this drives placement and early retention. WRTP/BIG STEP delivers pre-apprenticeship elements and OSHA-10 that employers recognize. IBEW Local 494 hosts jobsite rotations and mentors, linking to apprenticeship entry. System outcomes (fair-chance hiring, expanded slots) require collective work. Joint MOUs and supervisor training spread youth-friendly practices beyond our program.\n\n6) Risks & Mitigation (75\u2013100 words)\n- Retention: life crises, court dates, and housing instability. Mitigation: stipends tied to milestones, bus passes, emergency supports, flexible scheduling, and trauma-informed coaching.\n- Transportation and childcare gaps. Mitigation: MCTS passes, driver\u2019s license vouchers, childcare referrals, and aligning shifts with transit.\n- Background checks limiting access. Mitigation: expungement/record sealing clinics with legal partners; fair-chance host agreements; match youth to roles without prohibited tasks.\n- Staff turnover. Mitigation: cross-training, documented playbooks, caseload caps (max 12\u201315 youth/coach), and weekly case reviews with the 5-person team.\n\n7) Learning & Measurement (100\u2013150 words)\nIndicators\n- Outputs: enrollments; completion of OSHA-10; hours completed; number of rotations; placement count.\n- Short-term (6\u201312 months): % with soft-skill gains (pre/post rubric); % with OSHA-10; % with completed career plan; % with job offers/interviews.\n- Intermediate (1\u20133 years): 6- and 12-month job retention; wage at placement and at 12 months; % entering pre-apprenticeship or registered apprenticeship.\n- Long-term (3\u20135 years): % earning $20+/hour at 24 months; % in union roles/apprenticeships at 36 months; alumni job stability.\n- Impact (contribution): trend in youth disconnection and youth unemployment in target ZIPs.\n\nData sources and cadence: intake forms; attendance; coach observations; partner reports; pay stubs; 30/90/180/365-day check-ins; annual alumni survey; quarterly partner debriefs; ACS and City dashboard annual pulls. Use: monthly output huddles; quarterly outcome reviews to adjust recruitment, coaching dosage, and host mix; semiannual training for supervisors; escalate system barriers to partner leadership.\n\n8) Boundaries & Sustainability (40\u201375 words)\nWe do not provide mental health therapy, housing, or legal defense; we refer. Sustainability rests on braided funding: grants, Employ Milwaukee/WIOA reimbursements, union/host cost-share, and philanthropy for stipends and tools. For lasting impact, the ecosystem must expand fair-chance hiring, stabilize apprenticeship entry windows, and improve transit and childcare access.\nSigned: Aisha Thompson, Program Manager, 2025-11-02\n\n9) Visual Diagram Outline (text flowchart)\nBox 1: Problem \u2014 High youth disconnection in Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights; strong trades demand but access barriers (ACS 2023; City Workforce Dashboard 2024; DWD postings 2024)\n\u2193\nBox 2: Activities \u2014 Paid readiness + OSHA-10 (WRTP/BIG STEP); paid work-based learning (Employ Milwaukee); union jobsite rotations and mentors (IBEW 494); coaching and supports\n[Assumption: funding for stipends/tools; MOUs in place; youth can attend]\n\u2193\nBox 3: Outputs \u2014 50 enrolled; 45 OSHA-10; 35 placed; 30 complete 120+ site hours\n[Assumption: hosts provide meaningful tasks and feedback]\n\u2193\nBox 4: Short-term (6\u201312 months) \u2014 80% soft-skill gains; 70% secure offer or pre-apprenticeship interview\n[External: transit reliability; court dates]\n\u2193\nBox 5: Intermediate (1\u20133 years) \u2014 60% 6-month retention; 50% 12-month retention; 30% enter registered apprenticeship\n[Assumption: steady construction demand; fair-chance policies honored]\n\u2193\nBox 6: Long-term (3\u20135+ years) \u2014 50% earn $20+/hour at 24 months; 40% in union roles by 36 months\n[External: wage trends; economic cycles]\n\u2193\nBox 7: Impact \u2014 Contribute to 2\u20133 point drop in youth disconnection/unemployment in target neighborhoods (tracked via ACS and City dashboard)",

      "content": "# Youth Trades Launch Theory of Change\n\n**Version 1.0 | November 2, 2025 | Aisha Thompson, Program Manager**\n\n## Impact Statement\n\nYouth Trades Launch will help Black and Latino youth ages 16\u201324 in Milwaukee's Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights who are not in school and not working\u2014including those with prior justice involvement\u2014enter and remain in the skilled trades, reducing youth disconnection and increasing family-sustaining wages in these neighborhoods within five years.\n\n---\n\n## Problem & Root Causes\n\nIn Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights, 18% of young adults ages 16\u201324 are disconnected\u2014neither in school nor working\u2014nearly double Milwaukee's overall rate of 10% (2023 American Community Survey). Black and Latino youth face disconnection rates of 21% and 16%, respectively. The 2024 City of Milwaukee Workforce Dashboard shows that only 4% of Milwaukee youth under age 25 hold construction jobs, despite 2024 Wisconsin DWD data showing 3,200 open construction positions statewide with median starting wages of $18\u2013$22 per hour. Our 2024 listening sessions with 42 local youth revealed three barriers: lack of awareness of trade careers, no access to paid entry points, and distrust of institutions after prior negative school or justice system experiences.\n\nRoot causes include structural racism in hiring and apprenticeship networks that favor family referrals, transportation deserts that make job sites unreachable, and a criminal background screening process that permanently excludes justice-involved youth. These barriers persist because construction employers lack recruitment pipelines into Black and Latino neighborhoods, pre-apprenticeship programs charge fees many families cannot afford, and union entry requires connections most disconnected youth do not have.\n\n---\n\n## Pathway of Change\n\n**Activities \u2192 Outputs (Months 1\u201312)**\n\nIf Northside Neighbors Collective recruits 60 Black and Latino youth annually through Employ Milwaukee referrals and conducts 1:1 intake meetings within 72 hours, then 50 youth (83%) will enroll in a 12-week cohort. We assume youth will engage if outreach is peer-led and meetings happen in trusted community spaces. Our 2024 listening sessions showed that 89% of youth preferred meeting at neighborhood sites rather than downtown offices.\n\nIf enrolled youth attend WRTP/BIG STEP pre-apprenticeship training three days per week (120 hours total) and receive stipends of $15/hour for attendance, then 80% will complete OSHA-10 certification and basic hand-tool training within 12 weeks. This works because stipends remove the income barrier, and WRTP uses culturally responsive instructors. A 2023 Urban Institute study of paid pre-apprenticeships found 78% completion rates versus 45% for unpaid programs.\n\n**Short-Term Outcomes (6\u201312 Months)**\n\nIf completers rotate through three 4-week paid jobsite placements ($16/hour) with IBEW Local 494 electrical contractors and meet weekly with an assigned journey-worker mentor, then 70% will demonstrate soft-skill gains (punctuality, teamwork, problem-solving) on a supervisor rubric and 75% will report increased confidence in trade work on post-surveys. This assumes supervisors receive youth-centered training and provide real tasks, not make-work. Our staff will observe placements monthly to verify quality. Evidence from a 2022 meta-analysis of work-based learning (Jobs for the Future) shows that meaningful tasks with feedback drive skill gains.\n\n**Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 Years)**\n\nIf youth complete jobsite rotations and receive job-readiness coaching (resume, interview prep, credential portfolio), then 60% will enter registered apprenticeships or secure direct-hire trade jobs within 6 months of program exit, and 50% will retain those positions for 12+ months. This depends on labor demand remaining strong and employers hiring based on demonstrated skills rather than requiring clean backgrounds. The 2024 Milwaukee Workforce Dashboard shows 14% annual turnover in construction; we will track metro construction employment monthly via BLS data and adjust placement targets if demand drops.\n\nIf IBEW Local 494 and three partner contractors adopt fair-chance hiring policies that consider program completion as mitigating prior justice involvement, then at least 40% of justice-involved youth will be placed\u2014currently only 18% are. Northside Neighbors Collective will facilitate quarterly employer learning circles to shift hiring practices. A 2021 CLASP study found that employer education plus skilled candidate pipelines increased justice-involved youth hiring by 35% over two years.\n\n**Long-Term Outcomes & Impact (3\u20135+ Years)**\n\nIf 50% of participants retain trade jobs for 12+ months and advance to journey-level wages ($24\u2013$28/hour), then program alumni will earn family-sustaining incomes, reducing household poverty and contributing to a measurable decline in youth disconnection rates in Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights. We assume housing and transportation costs remain manageable; if not, earnings alone cannot stabilize families. Over five years, placing 150 youth (50/year \u00d7 3 cohorts with 50% long-term retention) can contribute to a 2\u20133 percentage point reduction in neighborhood disconnection rates, moving from 18% toward the citywide 10% benchmark.\n\n---\n\n## Preconditions & External Factors\n\nSuccess requires: signed MOUs with Employ Milwaukee, WRTP/BIG STEP, and IBEW Local 494 (secured); stable funding for stipends ($180,000 annually); and Milwaukee Metro Transit access to jobsites. Northside Neighbors Collective controls curriculum, mentoring quality, and referral processes. External factors beyond our control include metro construction labor demand (cyclical), state apprenticeship policies, and housing affordability. We will monitor BLS construction employment monthly and maintain a waitlist to scale cohorts up or down by \u00b110 youth. If demand drops below 2,500 open positions statewide, we will pivot placements toward residential service trades (HVAC, plumbing) using secondary employer contacts.\n\n---\n\n## Attribution & Partnership\n\nNorthside Neighbors Collective will recruit, coach, and coordinate the full participant journey, and can credibly claim credit for enrollment, completion, and short-term skill outcomes. Employ Milwaukee provides referrals and funds 50% of stipends through WIOA; WRTP/BIG STEP delivers technical training and OSHA certification; IBEW Local 494 supplies jobsite hosts and mentors. Job placements and wage gains are joint outcomes requiring all partners. Our role is essential but not sufficient\u2014without union access, youth cannot enter apprenticeships; without Employ Milwaukee funding, we cannot pay stipends. Systems change (fair-chance hiring policies) depends on Northside convening power and IBEW willingness to lead among contractors.\n\n---\n\n## Risks & Mitigation\n\n**Participant retention:** Youth may drop out due to childcare, housing instability, or trauma responses. Mitigation: Emergency funds ($200/participant) for transportation or childcare; trauma-informed coaching by bilingual staff; flexible re-entry within 90 days.\n\n**Employer bias:** Justice-involved youth may face discrimination despite skills. Mitigation: Facilitate employer learning circles; celebrate hiring success stories; position program completion as a credential.\n\n**Staff turnover:** Small team of five risks burnout. Mitigation: Peer support stipends; professional development budget; hire from the community with lived experience.\n\n**Policy shifts:** Changes to WIOA or apprenticeship eligibility. Mitigation: Diversify funding (private, city); join state advocacy coalitions.\n\nYouth voice: Quarterly alumni focus groups (paid $50 stipends) will review retention data and propose adaptations. In Year 1, feedback will shape mentor training content and jobsite placement length.\n\n---\n\n## Learning & Measurement\n\n**Indicators:**\n\n- **Outputs** (monthly): # enrolled; # completing 120-hour training; # OSHA-10 certified; # jobsite placements.\n- **Short-term** (6\u201312 months; quarterly): % showing soft-skill gains on supervisor rubric; % reporting confidence increases on exit survey.\n- **Intermediate** (1\u20133 years; biannually): % placed in apprenticeships or trade jobs within 6 months; % retained 12+ months; # employers adopting fair-chance policies.\n- **Long-term** (3\u20135 years; annually): % earning $24+/hour at 36 months; neighborhood disconnection rate trend (ACS).\n\n**Key learning questions:**\n\n1. Which jobsite rotation conditions (sector, supervisor style, task complexity) best predict 12-month retention?\n2. Do stipend levels ($15 vs. $18/hour) affect completion rates for parents vs. non-parents?\n3. What employer practices reduce bias against justice-involved youth?\n4. How do alumni wage trajectories compare to citywide trade worker benchmarks?\n\n**Data sources:** Attendance logs; OSHA certificates; supervisor rubrics; participant surveys (intake, exit, 6-, 12-, 24-month follow-up); partner employment records; quarterly focus groups; annual ACS neighborhood estimates.\n\n**Frequency & use:** Staff review outputs monthly and adjust outreach. Quarterly outcome reviews inform coaching strategies. Annual partner debrief identifies systems barriers; findings shared with funders and used to refine MOU terms and training content.\n\n---\n\n## Boundaries & Sustainability\n\nYouth Trades Launch will **not** provide mental health therapy, housing, or legal services; we will refer to partner agencies. Financial sustainability assumes a blend of WIOA (40%), private foundation (40%), and city workforce funds (20%) renewed annually. Operational sustainability requires maintaining five FTE and partner MOU renewals every two years. For impact to last, the broader ecosystem must change: employers must adopt fair-chance hiring, unions must expand access beyond referral networks, and the city must invest in transit to job centers. Without these shifts, we will serve individuals well but not reduce neighborhood-level disconnection.\n\n---\n\n**Aisha Thompson, Program Manager**  \n**November 2, 2025**\n\n---\n\n## Visual Diagram Outline\n\n**Box 1: PROBLEM**  \n18% of Black and Latino youth ages 16\u201324 in Sherman Park and Lindsay Heights are disconnected (not in school, not working); only 4% hold construction jobs despite 3,200 open positions statewide.\n\n\u2193\n\n**Box 2: ACTIVITIES**  \nPeer outreach + 1:1 intake \u2192 12-week WRTP/BIG STEP pre-apprenticeship (120 hours, $15/hour stipend, OSHA-10) \u2192 Three 4-week paid jobsite rotations with IBEW Local 494 ($16/hour) \u2192 Weekly mentor meetings \u2192 Job-readiness coaching.\n\n\u2193  \n*[Assumption: Stipends remove income barriers; jobsites provide real tasks; mentors complete youth-centered training.]*\n\n**Box 3: OUTPUTS (12 Months)**  \n60 recruited \u2192 50 enrolled (83%) \u2192 40 complete training (80%) \u2192 40 earn OSHA-10 \u2192 35 complete jobsite rotations (88%).\n\n\u2193  \n*[Assumption: Community-based outreach builds trust; flexible re-entry supports retention.]*\n\n**Box 4: SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES (6\u201312 Months)**  \n70% show soft-skill gains on supervisor rubric; 75% report increased confidence and trade knowledge on exit surveys.\n\n\u2193  \n*[Assumption: Supervisors use rubric consistently; surveys are culturally responsive.]*  \n*[External Factor: Youth face stable housing and transportation; monthly staff observation verifies jobsite quality.]*\n\n**Box 5: INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES (1\u20133 Years)**  \n60% placed in registered apprenticeships or direct-hire trade jobs within 6 months; 50% retained 12+ months; 40% of justice-involved youth placed (up from 18%) as 3+ employers adopt fair-chance hiring policies.\n\n\u2193  \n*[Assumption: Metro construction labor demand remains \u22652,500 open positions (tracked monthly via BLS); employers value program credentials.]*  \n*[External Factor: Housing costs and transit access; if demand drops, pivot to HVAC/plumbing placements.]*\n\n**Box 6: LONG-TERM OUTCOMES (3\u20135+ Years)**  \n50% of retained participants earn journey-level wages ($24\u2013$28/hour) at 36 months; alumni households move above poverty line.\n\n\u2193  \n*[Assumption: Wage progression follows union scales; cost of living remains manageable.]*\n\n**Box 7: IMPACT (5+ Years)**  \nSherman Park and Lindsay Heights youth disconnection rate declines from 18% toward 10% citywide benchmark; 150 alumni over 5 years contribute 2\u20133 percentage point reduction.\n\n*[Partner Contributions: Employ Milwaukee (referrals, stipend funding); WRTP/BIG STEP (training, OSHA); IBEW Local 494 (jobsites, mentors, fair-chance advocacy).

According to the 2024 County Health Rankings, all three counties perform below the state average for several key maternal and child health indicators. For example, Mitchell County has a higher rate of low birth-weight babies compared to the state average. NC DHHS 2023 data reveals that across these rural counties, infant mortality rates are concerningly higher than the state average, and prenatal care initiation in the first trimester is significantly lower. The 2022\u20132023 PRAMS NC highlights indicate that many pregnant individuals report experiencing stress, depression, or anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum, and face barriers to accessing healthcare, including transportation and provider availability. Furthermore, our 2024 maternal listening sessions (n=58) revealed widespread concerns about limited access to consistent, culturally-competent care, and feelings of isolation among new parents.\n\nThese issues stem from several interconnected root causes. A primary cause is structural inequity, specifically an ongoing lack of accessible and consistent healthcare services adapted to the rural setting. This includes limited public transportation options to clinics, few specialized providers, and long wait times for appointments. Another key factor is low health literacy surrounding prenatal and postnatal care, including understanding nutrition, safe sleep practices, and mental health support, exacerbated by a lack of trusted, culturally-relevant information sources. Finally, social isolation and economic instability, frequently seen in Appalachian communities, limit access to essential resources like healthy food, safe housing, and social support networks. This problem persists locally because of the sparse population distributed across a large geographic area, making service delivery difficult, and historical underinvestment in public health infrastructure in these rural mountainous regions.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Pathway of Change\n\n**If we offer trauma-informed, culturally-responsive home visits to pregnant people and new parents (activity), then 85% of enrolled participants will receive 6\u201310 home visits within the first year (output).**\n*Assumes families feel safe and respected by home visitors and trust the program\u2019s intent.*\n*Rationale: Regular, consistent engagement is essential for building rapport and delivering core content. Our listening sessions revealed a strong desire for trusted, non-judgmental support in the home.*\n\n**If participants receive consistent home visits from trained staff (output), then 80% of pregnant participants will demonstrate increased knowledge of healthy prenatal practices, including nutrition and warning signs, within 6 months of enrollment (short-term outcome).**\n*Assumes home visitors are well-trained in evidence-based curricula and can effectively convey information in an understandable manner.*\n*Rationale: Meta-analyses of home visiting programs consistently show improvements in maternal health knowledge when delivered by trained personnel, particularly when tailored to individual needs.*\n\n**If participants gain knowledge of healthy prenatal practices (short-term outcome), then 70% of pregnant participants will attend recommended prenatal care appointments and 60% will initiate prenatal care in their first trimester within their pregnancy term (intermediate outcome).**\n*Assumes transportation barriers are addressed (e.g., help with scheduling, connections to transport resources), and MountainCare FQHC provides timely prenatal care slots and warm handoffs.*\n*Rationale: Increased awareness of prenatal care importance and support in navigating the healthcare system directly contribute to improved engagement, as evidenced by studies showing higher appointment attendance among home-visited clients.*\n\n**If new parents increase their understanding of infant care, including safe sleep, breastfeeding, and infant development milestones, within 6 months of the baby's birth (short-term outcome from continued home visits), then 75% of new parents will adopt recommended safe sleep practices and 65% will exclusively breastfeed for at least 3 months, or adhere to recommended infant feeding guidelines (intermediate outcome).**\n*Assumes WIC offices effectively provide nutrition benefits and breastfeeding support, and home visitors are skilled in practical demonstrations and support.*\n*Rationale: Direct education and practical support from home visitors significantly influence parental behavioral changes around infant care, a finding supported by numerous studies on infant health practices.*\n\n**If parents have increased knowledge and support for their own mental health and well-being within 12 months (short-term outcome from ongoing home visits), then 60% of participating parents will report reduced symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety within 18 months postpartum (intermediate outcome).**\n*Assumes that home visitors are trained in basic mental health screening and can connect families to appropriate mental health resources, and the McDowell County Health Department provides accessible nurse consults.*\n*Rationale: Early identification and support for maternal mental health are critical. Evidence shows home visiting programs can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of postpartum depression when mental health is integrated into services.*\n\n**If pregnant people and new parents consistently adopt healthy prenatal behaviors, attend prenatal appointments, engage in recommended infant care practices, and manage their mental well-being (intermediate outcomes), then infant mortality rates within the program cohort will decrease by 20% compared to local baseline rates within 3\u20135 years (long-term outcome).**\n*Assumes that improvements in maternal and infant health practices directly translate to healthier births and reduced infant mortality, and participants continue to apply learned behaviors even after intensive home visiting concludes.*\n*Rationale: The cumulative effect of improved care practices is well-documented as a primary driver for reducing infant mortality rates, a key indicator highlighted by NC DHHS 2023 data.*\n\n**If program participants experience improved maternal and infant health outcomes over 3\u20135 years (long-term outcomes), then the overall rates of infant mortality and significant maternal and infant health complications in McDowell, Mitchell, and Yancey Counties will be measurably reduced over 5\u20137 years, contributing to systemic improvements in community health (impact).**\n*Assumes that a critical mass of families participates and improves, and that our efforts influence broader community norms and resource allocation over time.*\n*Rationale: While Blue Ridge Community Health Partners cannot solely claim population-level change, a successful, scaled program provides strong evidence and contributes significantly to positive trends, as demonstrated by other successful large-scale home visiting initiatives.*\n\n---\n\n### 4) Preconditions & External Factors\n\nOur success hinges on several preconditions: stable program funding for at least five years; formal Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with key partners ensuring consistent referrals and follow-up support; and a strong, accessible referral pipeline from local healthcare providers and social services. We also need access to reliable transportation solutions for families and a supportive, non-judgmental environment provided by our home visitors.\n\nFactors within our program control include the quality of our home visiting curriculum, the training and cultural competency of our staff, and our ability to build trusting relationships with families. External factors, such as changes in Medicaid coverage and eligibility, the availability of affordable safe housing, shifts in the local job market (affecting family income), and broader policy decisions related to rural healthcare, are largely beyond our direct influence. We will continually monitor these external factors through quarterly environmental scans and partner meetings, adapting our referral networks and advocacy efforts as needed to mitigate their negative impacts and capitalize on opportunities.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Attribution & Partnership\n\nBlue Ridge Community Health Partners\u2019 specific role is to deliver high-quality, evidence-based home visiting services directly to families. We can credibly claim attribution for the changes in participant knowledge, skills, behaviors, and the immediate health outcomes of their infants and themselves (e.g., safe sleep adherence, breastfeeding rates, prenatal care initiation, reduced postpartum depression symptoms). Our focus on culturally-responsive care, particularly for Appalachian, Latina, and Cherokee families, is a unique strength we bring to this work.\n\nOur partners are essential to key links in our pathway. The McDowell County Health Department provides crucial referrals of pregnant individuals to our program and offers nurse consults for complex medical questions or chronic conditions, directly supporting participants' access to clinical care. MountainCare FQHC provides vital prenatal care slots and facilitates warm handoffs, ensuring our participants overcome barriers to accessing timely and comprehensive medical care (intermediate outcomes: prenatal care attendance). WIC offices contribute by offering nutrition benefits and expert breastfeeding support, directly bolstering our efforts to improve maternal and infant nutrition and feeding practices (intermediate outcomes: breastfeeding adherence). All these partners contribute to a collective effort that aims to reduce infant mortality and improve overall maternal and infant health systems in our counties. Through joint planning and shared metrics, we influence the broader system of care for families.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Risks & Mitigation\n\nOne realistic barrier is participant retention, especially given the transient nature of some populations and rural transportation challenges. To mitigate this, we employ flexible scheduling, offer small incentives for participation, emphasize relationship-building, and provide stipends to cover direct costs like transportation or childcare. Another risk is staff turnover, which can disrupt family relationships. We will offer competitive salaries, professional development, and a strong supervisory support system for our 12 staff members, promoting a positive work culture. A third barrier is potential distrust from some community members due to historical experiences with external agencies, particularly among Appalachian and Cherokee families. Our mitigation involves hiring staff from the communities we serve, ensuring rigorous cultural competency training, and continuously incorporating beneficiary voice into program design through our maternal listening sessions and anonymous feedback channels. We are also committed to trauma-informed practices in all interactions. Policy shifts, such as changes to Medicaid eligibility, could impact our families' access to extended healthcare services; we will monitor these policies closely and advocate for our communities locally and at the state level.\n\n---\n\n### 7) Learning & Measurement\n\nOur 12 staff, supported by an annual survey budget, will use these indicators and learning strategies.\n\n**Indicators:**\n*   **Outputs:** % of enrolled families receiving \u22656 home visits within 12 months; # of referrals made to partners.\n*   **Short-term:** % of pregnant participants demonstrating increased knowledge (pre/post survey) of prenatal nutrition and warning signs by 6 months; % of new parents demonstrating correct safe sleep practices (observed) by 3 months postpartum.\n*   **Intermediate:** % of participants initiating prenatal care in the first trimester; % of new parents reporting reduced (e.g., 2-point drop on PSS-10) postpartum depression/anxiety symptoms within 18 months postpartum.\n*   **Long-term:** Average birth weight of infants in the program cohort compared to county average; % of infants in the program cohort aged 0-12 months with no preventable injuries-related emergency room visits.\n\n**Key Learning Questions:**\n1.  Which specific home visiting topics are most valuable to Appalachian, Latina, and Cherokee families, and how can we adapt our curriculum to be more effective?\n2.  What are the most persistent barriers to accessing prenatal care and mental health services in these rural counties, and how can our partnerships better address them?\n3.  Are there measurable differences in outcomes between families receiving more intensive vs. less intensive home visiting support?\n4.  How do participant feedback and satisfaction correlate with observed behavioral changes and health outcomes?\n\n**Data Sources:** Staff will collect data through structured home visit documentation logs, pre- and post-surveys (e.g., related to knowledge and screening tools), partner referral tracking forms, birth records (with consent), and annual participant satisfaction surveys. We will also conduct quarterly focus groups with a rotating selection of 5-7 families.\n\n**Frequency:** Outputs will be reviewed monthly by program staff. Short-term and intermediate outcomes will be tracked quarterly and reviewed during team meetings for progress. Long-term outcomes will be analyzed annually, in collaboration with partners where administrative data access is granted.\n\n**Use:** Findings will be discussed weekly in team supervision for immediate program tweaks and staff training needs. Quarterly aggregate data reviews will inform operational adjustments and partner engagements, and an annual report will guide strategic planning and funder communication. Negative or lagging trends will trigger a \"deep dive\" analysis, potentially leading to curriculum revisions or partner escalation.\n\n---\n\n### 8) Boundaries & Sustainability\n\nThis program will focus specifically on home visiting for maternal and infant health within the defined age and income brackets. We will *not* directly provide long-term childcare services or comprehensive housing support, though we will make referrals. For financial sustainability, we assume continued grant funding supplemented by state contracts for home visiting services. Operationally, we rely on maintaining strong, active partnerships and a consistent pipeline of trained, culturally competent home visitors. For impact to last beyond direct services, local primary care providers must maintain capacity for ongoing care, and public health policies must continue to support integrated maternal and infant health services.\n\n**Dr. Elena Ruiz, Director of Programs, 2025-11-02**\n\n---\n\n### 9) Visual Diagram Outline\n\n**Box 1: Problem (High infant mortality & poor maternal health in rural WNC)**\n\u2193\n**Box 2: Activities (Trauma-informed, culturally-responsive home visits)**\n\u2193 [Assumes: Families trust and engage with home visitors]\n**Box 3: Outputs (85% receive 6-10 home visits/year; Referrals to partners)**\n\u2193 [Assumes: Home visitors are well-trained and effective]\n**Box 4: Short-term Outcomes (Increased knowledge of prenatal care, healthy infant practices, identifying mental health needs within 6-12 months)**\n\u2193 [External Factors: Transportation access; MountainCare FQHC prenatal slots]\n**Box 5: Intermediate Outcomes (70% attend prenatal care, 65% safe sleep/feeding practices, 60% report reduced PPD/A by 1-3 years)**\n\u2193 [Assumes: Improvements in practice directly lead to healthier outcomes; WIC support is effective]\n**Box 6: Long-term Outcomes (20% reduction in infant mortality and fewer preventable complications within 3-5 years for cohort)**\n\u2193 [External Factors: Medicaid coverage continuity; Stable housing/economic conditions]\n**Box 7: Impact (Sustained reduction in infant mortality & improved community maternal/infant health in McDowell, Mitchell, Yancey Counties)**",

The 2024 County Health Rankings report higher teen birth rates and more low birthweight births in McDowell, Mitchell, and Yancey than the state average, alongside limited access to obstetric care. NC DHHS reports that North Carolina\u2019s infant mortality rate remains about 7 deaths per 1,000 live births, with persistent racial and geographic disparities (2023). North Carolina PRAMS 2022\u20132023 highlights show that many birthing people report depressive symptoms postpartum (about 1 in 5) and challenges meeting basic needs during pregnancy, both linked with adverse birth outcomes. Our 2024 maternal listening sessions (n=58) in the three counties surfaced practical barriers: long travel to prenatal care (often 30\u201360 minutes), missed appointments due to transportation and childcare, limited Spanish-language support, and anxiety about paying for care even with Medicaid.\n\nRoot causes:\n- Structural access gaps: Few local OB providers, long distances, limited evening/weekend appointment options, and inadequate transportation.\n- Economic stress: High rates of low-wage work and food insecurity at or below 200% FPL, affecting nutrition and the ability to attend care.\n- Structural inequities: Language access barriers for Latina families, cultural mismatches for Cherokee families, and historic distrust of systems. Coverage lapses and confusing benefits navigation also drive late or inconsistent care.\n\nWhy this persists locally: Rural provider shortages, fragmented referral systems, limited care coordination, and policy constraints (e.g., transportation coverage and benefit churn) continue to limit timely, continuous prenatal and postpartum support.\n\nSources cited in plain language: 2024 County Health Rankings; NC DHHS 2023 infant mortality and prenatal care data; 2022\u20132023 NC PRAMS highlights; our 2024 maternal listening sessions (n=58).\n\n3) Pathway of Change (STANDARD)\nActivities (what we do)\n- Home visiting: Nurse and community health worker (CHW) home visits biweekly during pregnancy and monthly until infant age 12 months; flexible evening/weekend options; tele-visits as needed.\n- Screening and education: EPDS/PHQ\u20119 and anxiety screening each trimester and at 6 weeks/6 months postpartum; tobacco/substance screening; safe sleep, injury prevention, and lactation coaching; birth and postpartum plan development.\n- Care coordination: Schedule prenatal care, pediatric well-baby visits, and WIC appointments; provide warm handoffs to MountainCare FQHC for prenatal care; coordinate with McDowell County Health Department nurses for consults; link to WIC for nutrition and breastfeeding support; arrange transportation and interpretation.\n- Material supports: Breast pumps, safe sleep kits, car seat checks, and gas cards for medical visits.\n\nOutputs (what we produce)\n- 150 families enrolled/year; 85% complete at least 6 home visits within 12 months.\n- 95% receive a prenatal care appointment within 14 days of enrollment; 80% attend it within 30 days.\n- 90% complete depression/anxiety screening each trimester and postpartum; 70% of those screening positive receive a follow-up plan within 14 days.\n- 90% receive safe sleep education; 85% have a documented safe sleep plan by 36 weeks; 90% receive a WIC referral; 80% complete WIC enrollment.\n\nIf-then links, assumptions, and rationale\n- If we deliver consistent nurse/CHW home visits with culturally responsive education and planning, then families will gain timely information and support, because trusted, repeated contact builds knowledge and confidence. Assumes stable staffing and bilingual capacity. Evidence from home visiting models shows gains in prenatal health behaviors and parenting practices.\n- If we schedule appointments, provide warm handoffs to MountainCare FQHC, and offer transportation/interpretation, then more clients will start and keep prenatal care, because we remove practical barriers that cause late entry or missed care. Assumes partner capacity and reliable transport. County Health Rankings and PRAMS link timely prenatal care with better outcomes.\n- If we screen for depression/anxiety and act on positive screens within two weeks, then more parents will engage in mental health care, because quick follow-up reduces drop-off after identification. Assumes coverage continuity for behavioral health and available providers. PRAMS highlights the burden of perinatal mood symptoms; early connection helps.\n- If we provide safe sleep kits and coaching, then parents will adopt safer sleep practices within 6 months postpartum, because hands-on tools plus simple cues drive behavior change. Assumes housing stability sufficient for a separate sleep surface. CDC guidance and prior program data show high uptake with combined education and equipment.\n- If we connect to WIC and offer lactation coaching and pumps, then more parents will initiate and continue breastfeeding at 8 weeks, because practical support and nutrition benefits address common barriers. Assumes timely WIC appointments and employer flexibility for pumping. WIC participation is associated with higher breastfeeding initiation.\n\nShort-term outcomes (6\u201312 months)\n- 80% show gains on a prenatal/infant care knowledge checklist within 3 months.\n- 85% adopt a safe sleep plan by 36 weeks; 75% report consistent safe sleep at 2 months.\n- 70% of those screening positive for depression/anxiety start treatment, peer support, or coaching within 30 days.\n- 85% attend first prenatal visit within 30 days of enrollment.\n\nIntermediate outcomes (1\u20133 years)\n- 75% achieve \u201cAdequate/Intermediate\u201d prenatal care utilization (APNCU index) across pregnancy.\n- 65% maintain breastfeeding at 8 weeks; 50% at 3 months.\n- 80% complete a 6\u20138 week postpartum visit; 70% select a desired contraception method (if wanted).\n- 85% of infants complete recommended well\u2011baby visits in first year; 80% on-time immunizations.\n\nLong-term outcomes (3\u20135+ years)\n- Participant preterm birth rate at least 20% lower than county baseline (e.g., from 10% to 8%) over rolling 3\u2011year cohorts.\n- Participant low birthweight rate at least 15% lower than county baseline over rolling 3\u2011year cohorts.\n- 25% reduction in preventable infant injury ED visits among participants by 12 months.\n- 30% reduction in moderate/severe depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum compared to intake.\n\nImpact (population level)\n- Over five years, counties show improved trends: higher timely prenatal care, fewer low birthweight births, and lower infant mortality, to which our cohort outcomes contribute alongside system partners.\n\n4) Preconditions & External Factors (STANDARD)\nPreconditions: Stable funding for home visiting; executed MOUs and data-sharing with McDowell County Health Department, MountainCare FQHC, and WIC; transportation vouchers; bilingual staff/interpretation; secure data systems; Medicaid billing set-up; referral pipelines from clinics and schools.\n\nWithin our control: Home visit quality and cadence; screening and follow-up; scheduling and warm handoffs; transportation and material supports; staff training.\n\nExternal factors: Insurance coverage continuity (e.g., Medicaid postpartum extension), provider capacity at MountainCare and WIC, transportation network, housing stability, and broader economic stress. We will monitor monthly partner capacity, track canceled appointments, and adapt with tele-visits, group visits, or mobile clinics when external constraints rise.\n\n5) Attribution & Partnership (STANDARD)\nBlue Ridge Community Health Partners\u2019 role: We deliver home visiting, education, screening, coordination, and supports. We can credibly claim participant-level outcomes tied to our services (e.g., timely prenatal entry, safe sleep adoption, screening and follow-up). We will not claim sole credit for county-level trends.\n\nPartner contributions:\n- McDowell County Health Department: Referral hub, public health nurse consults for high-risk cases, and data exchange on prenatal care starts; they strengthen our screening and care plans.\n- MountainCare FQHC: Reserved prenatal slots and warm handoffs ensure rapid access to clinical care; they are essential to our \u201ctimely prenatal care\u201d outcome.\n- WIC offices: Nutrition benefits, breastfeeding counseling, and pump access; critical to our breastfeeding and food security outcomes.\n\nSystem outcomes that require collective effort: County-level low birthweight and infant mortality trends depend on provider capacity, coverage policy, and social supports. Our joint work with public health and FQHCs, plus shared data and coordinated referrals, can shift systems (e.g., standard warm-handoff workflows and priority scheduling for high-risk pregnancies).\n\n6) Risks & Mitigation (STANDARD)\n- Participant retention and scheduling conflicts: Mitigation\u2014offer evening/weekend and tele-visits; provide gas cards and childcare stipends for clinic visits; use reminder texts in English/Spanish; assign consistent nurse/CHW teams.\n- Staff turnover or burnout: Mitigation\u2014competitive pay, reflective supervision, manageable caseloads (~12\u201315 families/staffer), and cross-training to ensure coverage.\n- Language and cultural barriers: Mitigation\u2014hire bilingual staff; contract interpreters; develop Spanish and culturally grounded materials; partner with Cherokee community advisors; use teach-back methods.\n- Policy or partner capacity shifts (e.g., Medicaid changes, clinic slot shortages): Mitigation\u2014monthly partner huddles, escalation protocols, backup telehealth prenatal education, and mobile clinic days with public health.\n\nWe will maintain beneficiary voice through quarterly pulse surveys (text-based), a parent advisory group meeting bimonthly, and rapid feedback loops after visits. We will adapt protocols when clients report barriers.\n\n7) Learning & Measurement (STANDARD)\nIndicators\n- Outputs: # enrolled; % completing 6+ home visits within 12 months; % scheduled and % attending first prenatal visit within 30 days; # WIC warm handoffs and completions.\n- Short-term: % scoring higher on prenatal/infant care knowledge checklist (pre/post); % with documented safe sleep plan by 36 weeks; % screened for depression/anxiety; % with follow-up plan within 14 days after a positive screen.\n- Intermediate: % Adequate/Intermediate APNCU; % breastfeeding at 8 weeks and 3 months; % attending postpartum visit by 7 weeks; % infants completing well-baby schedule and on-time immunizations.\n- Long-term: Preterm birth and low birthweight rates among participants vs county baseline; % with moderate/severe depressive symptoms at 6 months vs intake; participant infant injury ED visit rate by 12 months.\n- Impact (contribution): County trend lines for timely prenatal care, low birthweight, and infant mortality (County Health Rankings; NC DHHS).\n\nData sources and frequency\n- Administrative and EHR/visit logs: Weekly; monthly output dashboard.\n- Client surveys (pre/post knowledge; EPDS/PHQ\u20119; safe sleep): At enrollment, each trimester, 6 weeks, 6 months; quarterly roll-up.\n- Partner reports (MountainCare, WIC, Health Department): Quarterly debrief and slot/utilization summaries.\n- Listening sessions/focus groups: Semiannual.\n\nKey learning questions\n- Which visit elements (transport + warm handoff, safe sleep kit, lactation support) most strongly predict timely prenatal care and breastfeeding at 8 weeks?\n- Are outcomes equitable across Appalachian, Latina, and Cherokee clients? Where do we see gaps?\n- What volume/timing of visits is \u201cenough\u201d to shift preterm/low birthweight risk?\n- How do policy or partner capacity shifts affect completion of care plans, and what workarounds are most effective?\n\nUse of findings\n- Monthly: Adjust caseloads, visit cadence, and transportation supports.\n- Quarterly: Update partner MOUs and slot allocations; target staff training (e.g., lactation, motivational interviewing).\n- Annually: Revise goals, budgets, and advocacy priorities; publish a simple results brief to the board and partners.\n\nTeam capacity fit\n- With 12 staff and a moderate annual survey budget, we will keep tools short (checklists, EPDS/PHQ\u20119), use simple dashboards, and prioritize a small set of high-value indicators.\n\n8) Boundaries & Sustainability (STANDARD)\nScope limits: We do not provide clinical prenatal care, deliver babies, provide emergency transport, or long-term mental health therapy. We do not offer legal or immigration services.\n\nSustainability assumptions: Blend of grants, Medicaid reimbursement for home visiting and screening, county support, and in-kind partner services; stable staffing; maintained MOUs. For impact to last, the ecosystem needs durable OB capacity, transportation funding, and robust WIC/food supports. We will advocate with partners on these system needs.\n\nSignature: Dr. Elena Ruiz, Director of Programs, 2025-11-02\n\n9) Visual Diagram Outline\nBox 1: Problem \u2014 Rural maternal/infant health gaps (late prenatal care, low birthweight, high stress; travel and language barriers)\n\u2193 [Assumes community trust and referral flow]\nBox 2: Activities \u2014 Nurse/CHW home visits; screenings; education; scheduling + warm handoffs (MountainCare, WIC); transport/interpretation; safe sleep and lactation supports\n\u2193 [Assumes partner capacity and Medicaid coverage continuity; external: transportation availability]\nBox 3: Outputs \u2014 150 enrolled/year; 85% complete 6+ visits; 90% screened each trimester; 80% attend first prenatal within 30 days; 80% complete WIC enrollment\n\u2193 [Assumes consistent contact and reliable communication]\nBox 4: Short-term \u2014 Higher knowledge; safe sleep plans; treatment started after positive screens; timely prenatal entry (6\u201312 months)\n\u2193 [External factors: housing stability for safe sleep; provider access for MH care]\nBox 5: Intermediate \u2014 Adequate prenatal care use; breastfeeding at 8 weeks/3 months; postpartum visit; well-baby visits/immunizations (1\u20133 years)\n\u2193 [Assumes continued partner slots and family stability]\nBox 6: Long-term \u2014 Lower preterm and low birthweight among participants; fewer infant injury ED visits; lower maternal depressive symptoms (3\u20135+ years)\n\u2193 [External: county provider supply and economic stress]\nBox 7: Impact \u2014 County trends improve: more timely prenatal care, fewer low birthweight births, lower infant mortality (collective contribution)\n\nWhy this is a Theory of Change\nThis narrative explains how and why our activities lead to change, states assumptions and external factors, and sets testable targets so we can learn and adapt, not just list activities.",

HEADER & IMPACT STATEMENT\n\n**Ultimate Impact:**  \nPregnant people and new parents ages 15\u201334 at or below 200% of the federal poverty level in McDowell, Mitchell, and Yancey Counties\u2014including Appalachian, Latina, and Cherokee families\u2014will experience healthier pregnancies and better infant outcomes, reducing infant mortality and low birth weight rates across Western North Carolina's most vulnerable communities within five years.\n\n---\n\n## 2. PROBLEM & ROOT CAUSES\n\n**The Problem:**  \nInfant and maternal health outcomes in our three-county service area are among North Carolina's worst. McDowell County's infant mortality rate is 9.2 deaths per 1,000 live births\u2014double the state average of 4.6 (NC DHHS 2023). Only 67% of pregnant people in these counties receive adequate prenatal care compared to 78% statewide (2024 County Health Rankings). Our 2024 maternal listening sessions (n=58) revealed that 71% of participants missed at least two prenatal appointments due to transportation barriers, 64% reported confusion about infant feeding guidance, and 82% of Latina mothers said they lacked culturally relevant health information.\n\n**Root Causes:**  \nFirst, **geographic isolation and transportation poverty** create access barriers. These rural mountain counties have no public transit, and many families lack reliable vehicles or gas money for 45-minute drives to prenatal care.\n\nSecond, **systemic healthcare gaps** limit care quality. Only two OB providers serve all three counties. WIC and Medicaid enrollment processes are complex and available only in English at most sites. Provider cultural competency for Appalachian, Latina, and Cherokee families is minimal.\n\nThird, **structural poverty and policy barriers** compound health risks. With 23\u201328% of residents below the poverty line, families face food insecurity, unstable housing, and limited paid leave. North Carolina did not expand Medicaid until 2023, leaving many postpartum people uninsured after 60 days. PRAMS NC 2022\u20132023 data show women in poverty are three times more likely to experience postpartum depression but half as likely to receive mental health care.\n\n**Why It Persists:**  \nThe healthcare delivery system was not designed for rural, low-income families. Clinic-based care assumes patients can travel, take time off work, and navigate bureaucracy. No single provider coordinates the social, nutritional, and medical needs that shape birth outcomes. Until someone brings care to families' homes and connects fragmented services, the gaps will remain.\n\n---\n\n## 3. PATHWAY OF CHANGE\n\n**Activities \u2192 Outputs:**  \n**If** we provide 12 trained community health workers (CHWs) who deliver home visits every two weeks during pregnancy and monthly through baby's first year, **then** we will complete 3,200 visits annually serving 180 families across the three counties. CHWs will offer prenatal education, breastfeeding support, developmental screening, care coordination, and resource navigation\u2014all in English and Spanish, using culturally adapted curricula.\n\n**Key assumption:** Families will open their doors to CHWs. Our evidence: 88% retention in our 2023 pilot (n=34 families) when visits happened at participants' preferred times and CHWs shared cultural backgrounds.\n\n**If** we partner with McDowell County Health Department for nurse consultation on complex cases, MountainCare FQHC for warm handoffs to prenatal slots, and WIC offices for coordinated nutrition counseling, **then** each family will receive a seamless care plan instead of navigating three systems alone. CHWs will text appointment reminders, help complete forms, arrange rides through our volunteer driver network, and attend visits with families when requested.\n\n**Outputs \u2192 Short-Term Outcomes (6\u201312 months):**  \n**If** families receive consistent home visits with individualized support, **then** within 12 months:\n- 75% of pregnant participants will attend at least 80% of recommended prenatal visits (vs. 67% county baseline)\n- 70% will correctly demonstrate three safe sleep practices at 2-month postpartum visit\n- 65% will report increased confidence navigating healthcare and benefits systems (measured by validated self-efficacy scale)\n- 60% of breastfeeding mothers will exclusively breastfeed through 3 months (vs. 38% county rate per PRAMS)\n\n**Why this works:** Research shows home visiting builds trust and health literacy through repetition and relationship. A 2021 Cochrane review found home visits increased prenatal care attendance by 23% and exclusive breastfeeding by 18% in low-income populations. Our CHWs reduce logistical and knowledge barriers simultaneously\u2014the combination matters.\n\n**Key assumption:** Families have basic household stability (a phone, a place to meet). If housing or safety crises arise, CHWs will connect to emergency resources but cannot resolve homelessness or domestic violence alone.\n\n**Short-Term \u2192 Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 years):**  \n**If** knowledge and confidence increase, and access barriers decrease, **then** within 1\u20133 years:\n- Low birth weight rate among participants will drop to 7% (vs. 11% county baseline)\n- 80% of infants will be up-to-date on immunizations at 12 months (vs. 68% county rate)\n- Postpartum depression screening and linkage to treatment will reach 85% (currently 42% countywide per PRAMS)\n- Emergency department use for non-urgent infant issues will decline by 30% among participants\n\n**Why:** Preventive behaviors compound. When mothers breastfeed successfully, babies get sick less. When families know how to use primary care, ER visits drop. When postpartum depression is treated, caregiving improves. These intermediate outcomes require sustained behavior change, which our model supports through 15+ months of contact.\n\n**Key assumption:** Medicaid coverage remains continuous postpartum (recently extended to 12 months in NC). If coverage lapses, families lose prescriptions and well-child visits. We will track coverage and assist with re-enrollment but cannot control state policy.\n\n**Intermediate \u2192 Long-Term Outcomes (3\u20135+ years):**  \n**If** birth outcomes and early childhood health improve among program participants, **then** within 3\u20135 years:\n- Infant mortality rate among enrolled families will be 50% lower than county average (target: 4.5 per 1,000 vs. current 9.2)\n- 200+ children will enter kindergarten developmentally on-track (measured by Ages & Stages Questionnaire completed during visits)\n- Return on investment: Medicaid/emergency cost savings will offset 40% of program costs (based on similar programs' actuarial data)\n\n**Why:** These long-term outcomes represent children surviving, thriving, and entering school ready to learn. They require not just our program but also stable housing, adequate nutrition (WIC), safe childcare, and community conditions we influence but do not control.\n\n**Key assumption:** Families stay in the region. If economic displacement forces migration, we lose tracking but the child still benefits. We will measure outcomes for all enrolled families and separately for those who remain local 3+ years.\n\n**Long-Term \u2192 Impact (population-level, 5+ years):**  \n**If** we reach 30% of eligible families in the three counties (approximately 180 of 600 births annually to people below 200% FPL) and sustain the program for five years, **then** county-level infant mortality and low birth weight rates will begin trending downward. We will contribute to closing the rural-urban and racial/ethnic health gap documented in County Health Rankings.\n\n**Why contribution, not attribution:** Our program alone cannot eliminate infant mortality. Safe roads, Medicaid policy, SNAP benefits, hospital quality, water systems, and economic opportunity all matter. But home visiting is a proven, essential piece. If McDowell's infant mortality drops from 9.2 to 7.0 per 1,000 over five years, we can credibly claim we contributed 20\u201330% of that improvement based on our reach and the evidence base for home visiting.\n\n**Key assumption:** Partners sustain their roles. If MountainCare loses OB capacity or WIC faces federal cuts, referral pipelines break and outcomes suffer.\n\n---\n\n## 4. PRECONDITIONS & EXTERNAL FACTORS\n\n**What We Control:**  \n- Recruiting, training, and supervising 12 CHWs (8 English/Appalachian-fluent; 4 bilingual English/Spanish)\n- Securing MOUs with health department, FQHC, and WIC for coordinated referrals\n- Raising $680,000 annually (mix of Medicaid reimbursement, county contracts, foundation grants)\n- Delivering home visits with fidelity to evidence-based model (Parents as Teachers curriculum adapted for our region)\n\n**What We Need But Don't Fully Control:**  \n- Medicaid reimbursement for home visiting remains at $85/visit (state policy)\n- Referral volume from partners stays consistent (requires their staffing stability)\n- Volunteer driver network sustains 40 active drivers (community engagement)\n- Cell phone coverage in hollows and ridges (infrastructure)\n\n**What We Cannot Control:**  \n- Macroeconomic conditions (job availability, housing costs)\n- Federal/state safety net policy (SNAP, Medicaid eligibility, WIC funding)\n- Climate events (flooding, roads out, which are common in these mountains)\n\n**Monitoring and Adaptation:**  \nWe will review external factors quarterly with our Community Advisory Board (includes participants, CHWs, and partner staff). If Medicaid policy shifts, we'll adjust budget assumptions within 30 days. If partner capacity drops, we'll recruit backup referral sources or adjust enrollment targets. If transportation barriers worsen, we'll pilot telehealth visits for non-assessment contacts (already tested successfully during COVID).\n\n---\n\n## 5. ATTRIBUTION & PARTNERSHIP\n\n**Blue Ridge Community Health Partners' Specific Role:**  \nWe are accountable for recruiting families, hiring and supervising CHWs, delivering home visits, tracking participant outcomes, and coordinating the care team. We can credibly claim increases in prenatal visit attendance, breastfeeding rates, safe sleep practice, and health literacy among enrolled families because we directly provide these services and measure them.\n\n**Partner Contributions to Specific Pathway Links:**\n\n- **McDowell County Health Department** provides nurse consultation for high-risk cases (e.g., gestational diabetes, substance use) and co-leads monthly case conferences. Without their clinical expertise, CHWs would miss complications. They enable the link from \"home visit detects concern\" to \"family receives appropriate clinical care.\"\n\n- **MountainCare FQHC** guarantees prenatal appointment slots within 10 days of referral and accepts warm handoffs (CHW calls while with family). This partnership enables the link from \"CHW enrollment\" to \"adequate prenatal care.\" If families had to wait 6 weeks or navigate intake alone, visit attendance would not rise.\n\n- **WIC offices** coordinate nutrition benefits and breastfeeding peer counseling with our home visit schedule, so families hear consistent messages and avoid duplication. This enables the link from \"breastfeeding education\" to \"sustained exclusive breastfeeding\" because WIC counselors reinforce what CHWs teach and provide pumps, formula when needed.\n\n**Collective Outcomes:**  \nPopulation-level infant mortality reduction requires all of us plus hospital obstetric quality improvement, roads department (safe transport), housing authority (stable shelter), and employers (paid leave). We will track our participants' outcomes rigorously and report them to County Health Departments. We'll also participate in the regional Perinatal Health Collaborative, contributing data to joint advocacy for Medicaid postpartum coverage and transportation vouchers. Any county-level improvement is a collective win, not ours alone.\n\n---\n\n## 6. RISKS & MITIGATION\n\n**Risk 1: Participant Retention\u2014especially among highly mobile families and teens.**  \n*Mitigation:* CHWs will text between visits, offer flexible scheduling (evenings/weekends), provide small incentives ($25 gift card per trimester milestones), and use motivational interviewing rather than lecturing. We will track visit completion monthly and flag families who miss two visits for supervisor outreach. Teens will have option for peer group visits quarterly instead of one-on-one.\n\n**Risk 2: CHW Burnout and Turnover.**  \n*Mitigation:* We pay $18/hour (above regional average for similar roles), offer mileage reimbursement, provide bi-weekly reflective supervision, and limit caseloads to 15 active families per CHW. Annual training budget covers trauma-informed care and cultural humility. Exit interviews will identify systemic issues (e.g., unsafe roads, hostile landlords) that we can address organizationally.\n\n**Risk 3: Language and Cultural Barriers Beyond Spanish.**  \n*Mitigation:* We will partner with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians' Tribal Health program to co-design culturally specific materials and recruit a Cherokee CHW if enrollment from Yancey County (where Cherokee families concentrate) exceeds 15 families. For other languages (Marshallese, Vietnamese small populations), we will use Language Line interpreter service and pictorial materials.\n\n**Risk 4: Changes in Federal/State Funding for Medicaid or WIC.**  \n*Mitigation:* We diversify revenue (currently 40% Medicaid, 30% county contracts, 30% philanthropy). We maintain 3-month operating reserve. If Medicaid reimbursement is cut, we will reduce enrollment targets rather than cut visit frequency, preserving program fidelity. We will join state advocacy coalitions for advance notice of policy shifts.\n\n**Equity Note:**  \nAll mitigation strategies center participant voice. Our Community Advisory Board (50% current/former participants) reviews policies quarterly. Annual satisfaction survey (in English/Spanish, via text or paper) asks what barriers remain. CHWs complete equity training on implicit bias, historical trauma in Appalachia and among Indigenous and Latina communities, and LGBTQ+ affirming care.\n\n---\n\n## 7. LEARNING & MEASUREMENT\n\n**Indicators by Outcome Level:**\n\n*Outputs (tracked monthly via CHW visit logs):*\n- Number of families enrolled (target: 180/year)\n- Percent completing 80%+ of scheduled prenatal visits (target: 75%)\n- Total home visits delivered (target: 3,200/year)\n- Percent of high-risk cases co-managed with health department nurse (track volume)\n\n*Short-term outcomes (6\u201312 months, measured via pre/post surveys and observation):*\n- Percent attending 80%+ prenatal appointments (verified via MountainCare EHR data share, with consent)\n- Percent demonstrating 3 safe sleep practices (observed/self-reported at 2-month visit)\n- Mean score on Maternal Self-Efficacy Scale (administered at enrollment and 6 months)\n- Percent exclusively breastfeeding at 3 months (self-reported; cross-checked with WIC data)\n\n*Intermediate outcomes (1\u20133 years, administrative data + annual survey):*\n- Percent of births <2,500 grams (from birth certificates, with consent; compare to county rate)\n- Percent up-to-date on immunizations at 12 months (EHR data)\n- Percent screened for postpartum depression and linked to treatment if positive (PHQ-9 scores; referral tracking)\n- ER utilization rate for non-urgent infant issues (Medicaid claims data, aggregated)\n\n*Long-term outcomes (3\u20135 years):*\n- Infant mortality rate among enrolled families (vital records; small n means multi-year pooling)\n- Percent of children kindergarten-ready per ASQ-3 scores at age 4\u20135 visits\n- Cost savings estimate (Medicaid claims analysis vs. matched comparison group, if feasible with university partner)\n\n*Impact (population-level, contribution):*\n- County infant mortality trend line (NC DHHS vital stats)\n- County low birth weight rate trend line\n- Disparity gap between white/non-white and rural/urban rates (County Health Rankings annual)\n\n**Key Learning Questions:**\n1. Which visit frequency and duration work best for different family profiles (teen parents vs. older, first-time vs. multiparous)?\n2. Do warm handoffs to prenatal care increase attendance more than referrals alone? (test with randomized rollout if possible)\n3. What transportation solutions (volunteer drivers, gas cards, telehealth) are most cost-effective and participant-preferred?\n4. How do outcomes differ for Appalachian, Latina, and Cherokee families, and what adaptations improve equity?\n\n**Data Sources & Frequency:**\n- CHW visit logs (monthly review)\n- Participant surveys at enrollment, 6 months, 12 months, annually thereafter (moderate budget allows $8,000/year for survey incentives and analysis)\n- EHR data from MountainCare and health department (quarterly data share agreements)\n- Birth certificate and vital records (annual request to NC DHHS)\n- Focus groups with 10\u201312 participants annually ($1,500 stipends and facilitation)\n\n**Data Use:**\nProgram Manager reviews output data monthly and flags concerns (e.g., low visit completion in one CHW's caseload = coaching needed). Quarterly, Dr. Ruiz and team analyze short-term outcome trends and adjust training or protocols (e.g., if safe sleep demonstration rates drop, add visual aids). Annually, full team plus Community Advisory Board review all data, compare to targets, and decide on program changes (e.g., add evening group visits if retention among working mothers is low). Board receives a dashboard twice yearly with key indicators and a narrative explaining what we're learning.\n\n---\n\n## 8. BOUNDARIES & SUSTAINABILITY\n\n**What We Will NOT Do:**\n- Provide direct medical care (CHWs are not nurses)\n- Solve housing crises or domestic violence (we refer to specialists)\n- Serve families outside the three-county area or above 200% FPL (scope limits for now)\n- Continue visits beyond child's first birthday (unless extended funding allows)\n\n**Sustainability Assumptions:**\n- Medicaid reimbursement for home visiting continues at viable rate\n- At least two of three county governments renew annual $50,000 contracts\n- Foundation funding covers 25\u201330% of budget for first three years; we build individual donor base to replace by year four\n- Partner organizations remain financially stable and maintain their service commitments\n\n**Ecosystem Change Needed for Lasting Impact:**\nOur direct services can improve outcomes for 180 families per year, but systemic change must happen for population health to shift permanently. Within five years, we aim to influence:\n- Medicaid policy: 12-month postpartum coverage becomes permanent and reimbursement rates rise\n- Healthcare system: MountainCare and hospital adopt group prenatal care and extend OB capacity\n- Transportation: County governments invest in rural transit or medical transport vouchers\n- Workforce: CHW role is recognized and compensated equitably across healthcare systems\n\nWe will contribute by sharing our data, training other organizations in the model, and partnering with NC Home Visiting Coalition for state-level advocacy. If these systems strengthen, families beyond our caseload benefit and impact endures.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \n**Dr. Elena Ruiz, Director of Programs**  \n**Blue Ridge Community Health Partners**  \n**November 2, 2025**\n\n---\n\n## 9.

In 2024, the King County Regional Homelessness Authority dashboard (HMIS) reported over 1,700 homeless families with children, a significant portion of whom identify as Black and Latino. This crisis is fueled by exorbitant housing costs; the 2023 ACS housing cost burden and vacancy report indicates that over 50% of King County renters are cost-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on housing. Compounding this, the WA OFM 2024 rent and vacancy report highlights that the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Seattle exceeds $2,500, with a vacancy rate often below 3%, making affordable housing nearly impossible to find for families earning \u226430% Area Median Income (AMI). Our 2024 client feedback survey (n=312) further reveals that 85% of surveyed families cited inability to afford rent and security deposits as their primary barrier to housing.\n\nThe root causes of this family homelessness are deeply embedded structural inequities. Systemic discrimination in housing markets, exacerbated by historical redlining and ongoing implicit bias, limits access to safe and affordable housing for Black and Latino families. Policy barriers, such as insufficient affordable housing development and inadequate rental assistance programs, also contribute. Furthermore, survivors of domestic violence often face a rapid loss of housing and financial instability, a critical access gap unaddressed by conventional housing systems. These factors mean that even with a housing voucher, finding a landlord willing to rent to a family with a history of homelessness or an eviction on their record remains a significant barrier, perpetuating a cycle of instability.\n\n### Pathway of Change\n\n**Activities \u2192 Outputs:**\n\n*   **If** staff provide an average of 4\u20136 hours of housing search assistance weekly per family, including identifying available units, submitting applications, and coordinating with landlords, **then** 80% of enrolled families will apply to 5+ safe, affordable housing units within 30 days of program entry. *(Assumes families are motivated and have necessary documentation. Our practice shows individualized support significantly increases application rates).*\n*   **If** Puget Sound Family Housing Alliance (PSFHA) provides financial assistance covering security deposits, first and last month\u2019s rent, and utility arrears, **then** 90% of families with an accepted housing application will move into permanent housing within 45 days. *(Assumes landlords accept program funds and units are move-in ready. Rapid disbursement of funds is critical).*\n*   **If** case managers conduct home visits at least bi-weekly for the first 90 days post-housing, providing tenancy education, budgeting support, and connections to community resources, **then** 95% of families will participate in these direct support services. *(Assumes families trust their case managers and find the support relevant. Our client survey highlighted the crucial role of ongoing personalized support).*\n*   **If** PSFHA facilitates warm referrals to culturally responsive legal aid, childcare, employment services, and mental health support, **then** 75% of families will access at least two of these wrap-around services within 6 months. *(Assumes sufficient community partner capacity and accessibility of services. Our partner network is designed for seamless transitions).*\n\n**Outputs \u2192 Short-term Outcomes (6\u201312 months):**\n\n*   **If** families receive move-in financial assistance and tenancy education, **then** 90% will report increased confidence in their ability to manage a household and fulfill lease obligations within 6 months. *(Assumes financial barriers are the primary initial obstacle. Research on rapid re-housing consistently shows immediate housing reduces stress and builds confidence).*\n*   **If** families receive consistent case management and support with community resource navigation, **then** 70% will report improved financial literacy skills (e.g., budgeting, bill payments) within 9 months. *(Assumes active participation in skill-building activities. Our client feedback indicates a strong desire for practical financial guidance).*\n*   **If** families access legal aid and domestic violence advocacy, **then** 85% of survivors will report increased feelings of safety and stability in their homes within 6 months. *(Assumes legal and advocacy support effectively addresses safety concerns. Evidence shows holistic support for DV survivors is key to housing retention).*\n\n**Short-term Outcomes \u2192 Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 years):**\n\n*   **If** families gain confidence in household management and improve financial literacy, **then** 80% will maintain housing stability (defined as no evictions, no utility shut-offs, and consistent rent payments) for at least 12 months. *(Assumes ongoing access to emergency funds for crisis and stable income sources. Rapid re-housing models consistently demonstrate high housing retention rates over the first year).*\n*   **If** families maintain stable housing and access wrap-around supports (employment, childcare, mental health), **then** 60% will experience an increase in household income or access to benefits sufficient to cover housing costs by 18 months. *(Assumes job market stability and availability of living-wage jobs. Stable housing is a key determinant for employment success).*\n*   **If** families, especially survivors of domestic violence, achieve stable and safe housing, **then** 75% will report a decrease in stress-related health issues for adults and an improvement in children\u2019s school attendance or performance within 2 years. *(Assumes a direct link between housing stability, reduced stress, and improved well-being. Peer-reviewed studies confirm the positive health and educational outcomes associated with stable housing for families).*\n\n**Intermediate Outcomes \u2192 Long-term Outcomes (3\u20135+ years):**\n\n*   **If** families maintain housing stability for over a year and increase their income or benefits, **then** 70% will exit rapid re-housing subsidies and retain their housing independently for 3+ years. *(Assumes market stability doesn't prevent self-sufficiency, and families have built strong informal support networks. Sustained housing without subsidy is the ultimate measure of program success).*\n*   **If** families achieve long-term housing independence and improved household well-being, **then** the intergenerational cycle of homelessness for their children will be significantly disrupted. *(Assumes children\u2019s exposure to stable housing and consistent education fosters long-term positive developmental trajectories. Research consistently links childhood housing stability to adult outcomes).*\n\n**Long-term Outcomes \u2192 Impact:**\n\n*   **If** a significant number of families achieve long-term housing independence, **then** the overall rate of family homelessness in King County, Washington (Seattle metro area) will decrease. *(Assumes the program's reach and success are sufficient to contribute to a measurable population-level shift. This collective effort, alongside other initiatives, forms the impact).*\n\n### Preconditions & External Factors\n\nKey preconditions for our success include stable funding for rental assistance and program operations, formal Memoranda of Understanding with King County Regional Homelessness Authority for Coordinated Entry referrals, and robust partnerships with service providers like Landlord Liaison Program at Catholic Community Services and Northwest Justice Project. Access to reliable transportation for families and responsive communication channels with landlords are also critical.\n\nFactors within program control include the quality of case management, efficiency of financial disbursements, and strength of our community partnerships. However, persistent external systems challenges, such as the extremely high cost of housing in King County, the limited availability of affordable units (WA OFM 2024 report), and broader economic downturns affecting employment, are beyond our direct control. We will monitor these factors through quarterly reviews of market data (e.g., vacancy rates, rent increases) and economic forecasts. We adapt by advocating for systemic change, adjusting financial assistance limits, and diversifying our landlord outreach strategies to meet evolving market conditions.\n\n### Attribution & Partnership\n\nPuget Sound Family Housing Alliance\u2019s specific role is to provide the critical financial resources (rental assistance, deposits) and intensive, individualized case management that directly enables families to exit homelessness and maintain housing. We can credibly claim the successful re-housing and initial 12-month housing retention for families directly served by our program.\n\nOur partners are essential to various links in the pathway:\n*   **King County Regional Homelessness Authority** provides vital Coordinated Entry referrals, ensuring we reach the most vulnerable families, and manages the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) for data tracking.\n*   **Landlord Liaison Program at Catholic Community Services** is crucial for unit access and mediation, helping us overcome landlord hesitancy and secure leases for families who might face barriers. Their support directly enables the \u201cmove into permanent housing\u201d output.\n*   **Northwest Justice Project** provides expert eviction prevention legal aid, a critical wrap-around service that supports the intermediate outcome of \u201cmaintaining housing stability\u201d and helps families avoid re-entry into homelessness.\n\nThe long-term outcome of independent housing retention and ultimately, reduced family homelessness across King County, requires a collective effort. Our joint work with these partners strengthens the entire housing ecosystem, influencing systemic practices and improving access to resources far beyond what PSFHA could achieve alone.\n\n### Risks & Mitigation\n\n1.  **Risk: Landlord unwillingness to rent to families with prior evictions or utilizing rental assistance.** This disproportionately affects Black and Latino families due to systemic biases.\n    *   **Mitigation:** Proactive outreach to landlords, offering incentives (e.g., damage funds, quick payment), and leveraging the Landlord Liaison Program at Catholic Community Services for mediation and relationship building. Emphasizing trauma-informed landlord engagement training.\n2.  **Risk: Families disengaging from services due to competing priorities (e.g., childcare, work schedules, transportation).**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Providing flexible meeting times, offering transportation assistance (bus tokens, Uber/Lyft vouchers), utilizing remote support options, and ensuring case managers are culturally competent and trauma-informed. Offering small stipends for participation in specific workshops.\n3.  **Risk: Unexpected personal crises (e.g., health emergency, job loss, domestic violence recurrence) leading to financial instability.**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Maintaining a small emergency fund for one-time needs, strengthening connections to mental health and employment support, and providing access to Northwest Justice Project for eviction prevention. Proactive safety planning for survivors of domestic violence.\n4.  **Risk: Rapid rent increases or lease non-renewal in King County exceeding program\u2019s financial capacity.**\n    *   **Mitigation:** Continuous monitoring of market trends. Advocating for increased government subsidies and affordable housing development. Exploring innovative rental assistance models and maintaining open communication with funders about needs.\n\nBeneficiary voice shapes adaptations through anonymous post-program surveys, quarterly client advisory group meetings, and regular feedback loops with case managers. This ensures our services remain responsive to real-time needs and address equity gaps.\n\n### Learning & Measurement\n\n**Indicators:**\n\n*   **Short-term:**\n    *   % of families reporting strong/very strong confidence in managing household lease obligations (post-program survey, 6 months).\n    *   % of families demonstrating improved financial literacy scores (pre/post-assessment, 9 months).\n*   **Intermediate:**\n    *   % of families maintaining housing stability (no evictions/utility shut-offs) for 12 months (HMIS/case records).\n    *   % of families with increased household income or access to benefits by 18 months (case records).\n*   **Long-term:**\n    *   % of families retaining housing independently for 3+ years post-subsidy exit (HMIS/follow-up surveys).\n    *   % of children in program reporting regular school attendance and engagement (parent-reported survey, 2 years).\n\n**Key Learning Questions:**\n\n1.  What are the most effective landlord engagement strategies for Black and Latino families, given historical discrimination?\n2.  How does the duration and intensity of post-housing case management impact long-term housing stability outcomes beyond 1 year?\n3.  What specific wrap-around services (e.g., legal aid, childcare, mental health) are most correlated with increased household income and housing retention for survivors of domestic violence?\n\n**Data Sources:** HMIS data, PSFHA internal case management records, pre/post client surveys, partner service utilization reports, qualitative focus groups with families, landlord feedback.\n\n**Frequency:**\n*   Output review: Monthly staff meeting.\n*   Short-term outcomes: Quarterly data review for program adjustments.\n*   Intermediate outcomes: Bi-annual deep dives with evaluation staff.\n*   Long-term outcomes/Impact: Annual report and partner debrief.\n\n**Use:** Findings from these measures will directly inform program tweaks (e.g., revising financial literacy curriculum), staff training needs (e.g., enhanced landlord negotiation skills), and partner escalation (e.g., advocating for specific policy changes with the King County Regional Homelessness Authority or increasing legal aid referrals). Our strong evaluation staff will analyze data to identify trends, celebrate successes, and pinpoint areas for improvement, ensuring continuous program adaptation.\n\n### Boundaries & Sustainability\n\nThe Keys to Stability Rapid Re-Housing program will **NOT** directly operate long-term supportive housing or provide property management services. Our focus is on rapid re-entry into stable housing and short-to-medium-term supports to foster independence. Our core assumption for financial sustainability is continued grant funding and philanthropic support. Operational sustainability relies on maintaining strong relationships with Coordinated Entry and our service partners, as well as retaining our experienced 48-person team. For impact to last beyond direct services, the broader King County housing ecosystem must change significantly, including substantial increases in affordable housing stock, expansion of rent subsidy programs, and policy reforms addressing systemic discrimination in housing.\n\nMonica Patel, Senior Director of Impact, 2025-11-02\n\n### Visual Diagram Outline\n\nBox 1: Problem (Families in King County experiencing homelessness, high housing cost burden)\n\u2193\nBox 2: Activities (Housing search assistance; financial assistance for deposits/rent; bi-weekly home visits/tenancy education; referrals to wrap-around services)\n[Assumes: motivated families, necessary documents, rapid fund disbursement, trust in case managers, partner capacity]\n\u2193\nBox 3: Outputs (80% apply to 5+ units/30 days; 90% move into housing/45 days; 95% participate in support services; 75% access 2+ wrap-around services/6 months)\n\u2193\nBox 4: Short-term Outcomes (90% increased household management confidence/6 months; 70% improved financial literacy/9 months; 85% increased safety for DV survivors/6 months)\n\u2193 [Assumes: ongoing crisis support, stable income, market stability] (External Factor: Housing Market Stability)\nBox 5: Intermediate Outcomes (80% housing stability for 12+ months; 60% increased income/benefits by 18 months; 75% improved family well-being/2 years)\n\u2193 [Assumes: sustained self-sufficiency, strong support networks] (External Factor: Affordability of Market Rate Housing)\nBox 6: Long-term Outcomes (70% exit subsidy & retain housing 3+ years; Intergenerational cycle of homelessness disrupted)\n\u2193\nBox 7: Impact (Reduced rate of family homelessness in King County)",

The 2023 American Community Survey shows about 45% of renter households in King County are cost-burdened and about 22% are severely cost-burdened, leaving little room for emergencies. The Washington Office of Financial Management\u2019s 2024 rental and vacancy report shows apartment vacancy around 4\u20135% in urban King County and median two-bedroom rents near $2,400, far out of reach for families at \u226430% AMI. The 2024 King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA) HMIS dashboard indicates family inflow to homelessness continues to exceed exits in parts of the county, and returns to homelessness within a year remain a concern. In our 2024 client feedback survey (n=312), 68% reported landlord screening barriers (credit, eviction records, income multiples) and 57% reported discrimination based on race, vouchers, or family size when searching for housing.\n\nRoot causes include a structural wage\u2013rent gap; low vacancy that strengthens landlord screening and raises deposits; and racial inequities in both the homelessness system and the rental market that disproportionately affect Black and Latino families. Domestic violence also drives homelessness; survivors need quick, confidential placements and trauma-informed support. The problem persists locally because deeply affordable units are scarce, time-limited rent help often ends before incomes stabilize, and families face fragmented access to legal aid, landlord mediation, and flexible funds.\n\nSources: 2024 KCRHA HMIS dashboard; 2023 ACS/Census; WA OFM 2024 rent and vacancy report; PSFHA 2024 client feedback survey (n=312).\n\n3) Pathway of Change\nActivities (what we do)\n- Rapid Re-Housing with progressive engagement: up to 12 months of rent and utility assistance, tapering as income rises; average planned assistance 9\u201310 months.\n- Housing navigation and landlord engagement: unit search, application support, landlord negotiation; use the Landlord Liaison Program (Catholic Community Services) for unit access and mediation.\n- Flexible funds: application fees, deposits, arrears, moving costs; disbursed within 3 business days.\n- Case management: weekly contact for first 90 days, then biweekly; tenancy skills, budgeting, benefits enrollment, DV safety planning, school stability.\n- Legal access: referrals to Northwest Justice Project for eviction prevention, record sealing, and fair housing enforcement.\n- Data and coordination: enrollments via KCRHA Coordinated Entry; all services tracked in HMIS.\n\nOutputs (what we produce)\n- 220 families enrolled annually; 90% complete a housing plan within 30 days; 80% placed in housing within 60 days; average assistance $1,200/month; 150 landlord partners engaged; 120 legal referrals; 200 safety plans completed for DV survivors.\n\nIf-then link 1: If families receive fast housing navigation, landlord matchmaking, and flexible funds, then most will secure a lease in 60 days because reduced screening barriers and quick fee coverage make applications competitive in a low-vacancy market. Assumes landlords honor commitments and flexible funds are disbursed within 3 business days. Rationale: Our last year\u2019s median time-to-housing was 58 days under these conditions, and KCRHA HMIS shows faster exits when rent assistance plus landlord mediation are combined.\n\nShort-term outcomes (6\u201312 months)\n- 90% complete tenancy skills and rights training; 85% enroll in all eligible benefits (SNAP, TANF, child care); 80% have a written budget and savings plan; 95% of DV survivors have a current safety plan; 85% of school-age children remain in their home school through year-end.\n\nIf-then link 2: If families receive tenancy training, budgeting support, and benefit enrollment while housed, then they will increase knowledge and reduce crisis moves within 6\u201312 months because practical skills and cash-like supports stabilize monthly costs. Assumes consistent case manager contact and language access. Rationale: Our client survey found 72% reported better landlord communication and 66% reported fewer missed bills after training and benefits enrollment.\n\nIntermediate outcomes (1\u20133 years)\n- 75% remain stably housed at 12 months post-enrollment; 65% increase earned or unearned income by \u226510% within 12 months; 90% avoid any eviction filing during program and within 6 months of exit; 80% maintain the same school or district through the next school year; county returns to homelessness within 12 months among our exit cohort at or below 15%.\n\nIf-then link 3: If rent support tapers as income and benefits rise, with legal support when needed, then families will maintain housing for 12\u201324 months because financial gaps narrow while tenants learn to navigate rights and responsibilities. Assumes basic labor demand and benefit continuity. Rationale: HMIS trend data locally shows better 12\u2011month stability for households receiving at least 6 months of stepped rent help plus mediation access.\n\nLong-term outcomes (3\u20135+ years)\n- 70% remain housed 24 months after enrollment; 55% maintain housing without ongoing subsidy by 24 months; the racial gap in exits to permanent housing between Black/Latino and white families narrows by 10 percentage points among our participants.\n\nIf-then link 4: If families secure leases, build tenancy records, and avoid court filings, then long-term stability increases because positive rental history and reduced debt improve unit choice and renewals. Assumes credit repair and landlord references are obtainable. Rationale: Practice experience and partner reports show fewer court records correlate with renewals and lower move-out rates.\n\nImpact (population-level change)\n- Contribution to county-wide reductions in families entering homelessness and in 12\u2011month returns, especially for Black and Latino families. As our annual placements scale to 220 families and landlord participation grows, more family units remain available to coordinated entry.\n\nAssumption: System capacity (units and subsidies) holds steady; partners maintain service coverage. Rationale: Collective exits must exceed inflow to shift county trend lines; our placements and reduced returns contribute to that balance.\n\n4) Preconditions & External Factors\nPreconditions: Stable funding for rent assistance and flexible funds; signed MoUs with KCRHA, Landlord Liaison Program, and Northwest Justice Project; trained staff (48) with manageable caseloads; language access and trauma-informed practices; HMIS access; secure DV protocols. External factors: rent inflation, vacancy rates, wage trends, child care access, state tenant laws, and voucher availability. Within our control: service quality, speed of payments, landlord relationships, participant supports. Outside our control: macro housing supply and labor market. We will monitor KCRHA dashboards monthly, WA OFM rent/vacancy quarterly, and adjust subsidy length, tapering, and landlord incentives when market conditions tighten.\n\n5) Attribution & Partnership\nPuget Sound Family Housing Alliance (PSFHA) will directly deliver housing navigation, rent/utility assistance, case management, and flexible funds. We can credibly claim outputs and short\u2011term outcomes, and a direct contribution to intermediate outcomes for families we serve. KCRHA provides coordinated entry referrals and HMIS infrastructure, enabling quick enrollments and shared outcome tracking. The Landlord Liaison Program at Catholic Community Services expands unit access, offers risk mitigation to owners, and mediates disputes\u2014key to the activities-to-output link and to avoiding eviction filings. Northwest Justice Project provides eviction prevention, record sealing, and fair housing enforcement, which underpins the maintenance-of-housing outcomes. County-level impact (reduced inflow and returns, narrowed disparities) requires collective effort across these partners and the broader housing ecosystem. Our joint work increases the share of available units accepting assisted tenants and reduces harmful legal records, nudging system practice toward fairer screening and faster exits.\n\n6) Risks & Mitigation\n- Unit scarcity or rent spikes: Mitigation\u2014deepen landlord pipeline with sign-up targets, offer risk mitigation funds and holding fees, prioritize lease-up in high\u2011opportunity neighborhoods, and adjust assistance length based on market scans.\n- Screening discrimination (race, vouchers, family size): Mitigation\u2014pair tenants with fair-housing education, route cases to Northwest Justice Project, conduct landlord trainings, and track denials by reason to intervene. Provide translation, childcare, and transportation stipends for showings.\n- Participant retention and trauma: Mitigation\u2014use flexible scheduling, text-based check\u2011ins, mobile visits, and survivor\u2011led safety planning; offer culturally responsive services and motivational interviewing.\n- Staff turnover or burnout: Mitigation\u2014maintain caseload targets (no more than 20\u201325 families per case manager), reflective supervision, secondary trauma supports, and competitive pay; cross-train to prevent service gaps.\nBeneficiary voice: We run quarterly SMS surveys, a Family Advisory Council (10\u201312 parents), and case review panels that include alumni; we change practices based on this feedback.\n\n7) Learning & Measurement\nIndicators\n- Outputs: number enrolled; median days from enrollment to lease; average and total assistance per family; number of landlord partners; number of legal referrals; percent completing housing plan in 30 days.\n- Short-term (6\u201312 months): percent completing tenancy training; percent with benefits enrollment; percent with written budget; percent of DV survivors with active safety plan; student school stability rate by semester.\n- Intermediate (1\u20133 years): percent stably housed at 6 and 12 months; percent with \u226510% income gain by 12 months; percent with no eviction filings during program and within 6 months post-exit; 12\u2011month returns to homelessness rate for exit cohort.\n- Long-term (3\u20135+ years): percent housed at 24 months; percent housed at 24 months without subsidy; racial gap in permanent housing exits among our participants; landlord renewal rate at first lease end.\n\nKey learning questions\n- What level and duration of assistance yields the best 12\u2011 and 24\u2011month stability for families at \u226430% AMI?\n- Which landlord practices (incentives, mediation) most reduce screening denials for Black and Latino families?\n- Which participant supports most predict \u201cno eviction filing\u201d (legal aid timing, arrears coverage, safety planning)?\n- How should we adjust tapering when rents rise faster than incomes?\n\nData sources and frequency\n- HMIS and internal case management system: monthly output review; quarterly outcome checks.\n- Client surveys (SMS/web) and focus groups: semiannual.\n- Partner reports (Landlord Liaison Program; Northwest Justice Project): quarterly.\n- KCRHA dashboard; WA OFM rent/vacancy; ACS updates: annual.\nUse of findings\n- Monthly huddles to adjust caseloads and payment timing.\n- Quarterly learning sprints to revise subsidy tapering and landlord incentives.\n- Annual partner debrief to refine referral criteria and dispute-resolution protocols; escalate policy issues to KCRHA.\n\n8) Boundaries & Sustainability\nScope limits: We do not provide permanent supportive housing, long-term subsidies beyond 12\u201318 months, mental health or substance use treatment, or immigration legal services; we refer to partners. Sustainability assumes blended public contracts, philanthropy for flexible funds, and stable partner infrastructure. Durable impact requires more deeply affordable family units, fair-chance screening, child care access, and livable wages.

Impact Statement\n\nFamilies with children experiencing homelessness in King County\u2014disproportionately Black and Latino households led by adults 18 and older, including domestic violence survivors earning at or below 30% Area Median Income\u2014achieve stable, independent housing within three years, reducing family homelessness recidivism and housing cost burden across the Seattle metro region.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Problem & Root Causes\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nFamilies with children represent 32% of the homeless population in King County, according to the 2024 King County Regional Homelessness Authority HMIS dashboard. Black families are overrepresented at 3.2 times their share of the county population; Latino families at 1.8 times. The 2023 American Community Survey shows that 68% of renter households earning below 30% AMI are severely cost-burdened, spending more than half their income on rent. The Washington Office of Financial Management 2024 report documents median rent at $1,850 per month with vacancy rates below 3.5%, leaving virtually no affordable units for extremely low-income families. Our 2024 client feedback survey (n=312) found that 74% of families experienced homelessness after a sudden income loss, eviction, or fleeing domestic violence, and 81% cited lack of landlord willingness to rent to families with eviction or credit histories as the primary barrier to securing housing.\n\n**Root Causes**\n\nFirst, structural racism in housing policy and lending has created wealth gaps that leave Black and Latino families with fewer financial buffers when crisis strikes. Discriminatory screening practices by landlords systematically exclude families with prior evictions, criminal records, or poor credit\u2014barriers that disproportionately affect communities of color and survivors of domestic violence.\n\nSecond, the King County rental market produces virtually zero units affordable to families at or below 30% AMI without subsidy. Landlords can select tenants from hundreds of applicants, making background or income imperfections disqualifying.\n\nThird, time-limited emergency shelter systems do not provide the stability families need to address employment barriers, heal from trauma, or navigate complex application processes for permanent housing. Families cycle between shelters, doubled-up arrangements, and vehicles, compounding children's school disruptions and caregivers' ability to maintain work.\n\nThe problem persists because policy responses have favored permanent supportive housing for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness, leaving families in a gap: ineligible for deeply subsidized units but unable to compete in the private market without flexible financial assistance, landlord mediation, and case management.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Pathway of Change\n\n**Activities \u2192 Outputs**\n\nIf Puget Sound Family Housing Alliance provides rapid re-housing assistance\u2014rental subsidies averaging $1,200/month for up to 18 months, flexible financial assistance up to $3,000 per household for move-in costs and emergencies, intensive case management (weekly contact tapering to monthly), and employment or benefit enrollment support\u2014then we will serve 240 families annually and place 85% into permanent housing within 60 days of program enrollment.\n\nThis causal link assumes two conditions: (1) the King County Regional Homelessness Authority coordinated entry system prioritizes families for referral based on vulnerability and program match, ensuring we reach those most in need; and (2) the Landlord Liaison Program at Catholic Community Services successfully recruits at least 180 units annually willing to accept flexible screening criteria. Evidence: a 2022 national evaluation of rapid re-housing by Abt Associates found that programs offering 12\u201318 months of rental assistance achieved 82% housing placement rates, compared to 54% for programs capped at six months.\n\n**Outputs \u2192 Short-Term Outcomes (6\u201312 months)**\n\nIf families move into stable housing with predictable monthly costs and receive weekly case management that addresses income, childcare, transportation, and benefits, then within 12 months 70% of heads of household will increase earned income or benefit income by at least 15%, and 80% will report reduced housing instability stress (measured by the Family Housing Stability Scale). \n\nKey assumptions: (1) flexible funds are disbursed within five business days to prevent eviction or utility shut-off, maintaining housing stability during the income-building phase; and (2) case managers have caseloads capped at 20 families, enabling the relationship depth needed for trauma-informed, tailored support. Our own 2023 program data showed families receiving same-week flexible assistance were 2.3 times more likely to remain housed at 12 months than those waiting more than 10 days. Research from the Family Options Study (HUD, 2016) demonstrated that rapid re-housing reduced family separations and improved caregiver mental health within the first year compared to shelter-only interventions.\n\n**Short-Term \u2192 Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 years)**\n\nIf families sustain housing and build income over 12\u201318 months with tapering case management support, then 75% will maintain permanent housing without program subsidy at 24 months post-enrollment, and 60% will reduce their rent burden to below 50% of income by month 30.\n\nThis link depends on landlords maintaining lease agreements even after subsidy ends, which requires trust built through the Landlord Liaison Program's mediation and damage mitigation fund (up to $2,500 per unit). It also assumes local labor markets offer entry-level positions at or above $18/hour (current King County minimum wage) and that childcare subsidies through Working Connections Child Care remain available. The Northwest Justice Project's eviction prevention legal aid provides a critical safety net; families who receive early legal intervention are 68% less likely to face eviction, according to project data shared in partnership meetings. King County HMIS data from similar rapid re-housing programs show 72% housing retention at 24 months when rental assistance spans at least 12 months and case management extends through month 18.\n\n**Intermediate \u2192 Long-Term Outcomes (3\u20135 years)**\n\nIf families remain stably housed for two years and caregivers sustain employment or benefit income sufficient to cover rent, then 65% of families will remain in permanent housing at five years, children will maintain enrollment in the same school for at least two consecutive academic years (reducing disruption), and families will build savings or assets (20% will have $500 or more in emergency savings by year four).\n\nAssumptions here extend beyond program control: regional rent increases must not outpace wage growth by more than 5% annually, and families must retain access to safety-net programs (SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, childcare subsidies). The King County Regional Homelessness Authority's system-level investments in eviction prevention and homelessness diversion create an ecosystem that supports long-term stability. A five-year cohort study by the University of Washington found that families exiting rapid re-housing into subsidized or naturally affordable units (rent \u226430% of income) had homelessness recidivism rates of 12%, compared to 34% for families placed into units requiring more than 40% of income.\n\n**Long-Term Outcomes \u2192 Impact**\n\nIf a growing proportion of families achieve five-year housing stability and Kings County invests in complementary system supports (coordinated entry prioritization, landlord incentives, legal aid, flexible funding pools), then the overall rate of family homelessness recidivism will decline by 10% over five years, and the share of Black and Latino families experiencing repeat homelessness will decrease, narrowing racial disparities in housing stability across King County.\n\nThis population-level impact is a contribution, not sole attribution. It requires sustained public funding, continued partnership among at least 15 homelessness service providers, policy reforms (e.g., Just Cause eviction ordinances, source-of-income discrimination bans), and increased affordable housing production. Our role is to demonstrate that time-limited, well-resourced rapid re-housing works for families and to use data and client voice to advocate for systemic change.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Preconditions & External Factors\n\n**Preconditions for Success**\n\nThis Theory of Change depends on five preconditions largely within program control: (1) stable funding commitments for at least 18 months of rental assistance per family; (2) signed Memoranda of Understanding with the King County Regional Homelessness Authority for coordinated entry referrals, the Landlord Liaison Program for unit recruitment, and Northwest Justice Project for legal aid; (3) a workforce of 48 trained case managers, housing navigators, and evaluators with competitive wages and supervision; (4) technology infrastructure (HMIS access, data dashboards, encrypted client communication); and (5) physical office space accessible by public transit with private meeting rooms for trauma-informed case management.\n\n**External Factors**\n\nFactors outside our control include King County rental vacancy rates (currently 3.5%; stability requires \u22655%), rent inflation (averaged 6.2% annually 2021\u20132024), availability of federal Housing Choice Vouchers for families exiting rapid re-housing, state-level childcare subsidy waitlists, and employer hiring practices. We will monitor the Washington Office of Financial Management quarterly rent reports and King County HMIS system performance measures. When external conditions worsen\u2014such as rent spikes above 7% annually\u2014we will extend subsidy duration from 15 to 18 months for affected cohorts, advocate jointly with partners for emergency rental assistance appropriations, and prioritize families for voucher referrals through coordinated entry.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Attribution & Partnership\n\n**Puget Sound Family Housing Alliance Role**\n\nPuget Sound Family Housing Alliance directly provides rental subsidies, flexible funds, case management, and employment support, and can credibly claim responsibility for housing placement rates, 12-month retention, and income gains among enrolled families. We manage the therapeutic relationship and financial resources that stabilize families during the acute crisis and transition phases.\n\n**Partner Contributions**\n\nThe King County Regional Homelessness Authority operates coordinated entry, ensuring families are referred based on standardized vulnerability assessments rather than first-come access, which reduces racial bias and targets resources effectively. KCRHA also maintains the HMIS data system that enables tracking and learning. Without coordinated entry, we would serve a less vulnerable population and lose the ability to measure contribution to system-level outcomes.\n\nThe Landlord Liaison Program at Catholic Community Services recruits private-market units, negotiates flexible screening (accepting families with eviction or credit barriers), mediates landlord-tenant conflicts, and administers a damage mitigation fund. This partnership directly enables the output (85% placement within 60 days) and the intermediate outcome (landlord willingness to renew leases post-subsidy). Our case management quality matters less if families cannot access units.\n\nThe Northwest Justice Project provides eviction prevention legal representation, which protects the intermediate outcome (75% retention at 24 months). Their intervention\u2014filing answers, negotiating payment plans, connecting families to emergency funds\u2014catches families before lease termination. Legal aid is not our expertise; partnership allows specialization and maximizes family stability.\n\n**Collective Outcomes**\n\nThe long-term outcome (65% stability at five years) and the impact (10% reduction in family homelessness recidivism) require all partners plus policy actors, housing developers, and employers. Our data will inform KCRHA's system performance reports, and client stories will support joint advocacy for Just Cause eviction protections and source-of-income anti-discrimination laws. We share credit and accountability.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Risks & Mitigation\n\n**Risk 1: Participant Retention**\n\nFamilies may disengage from case management after housing placement due to work schedules, distrust from prior system involvement, or believing services are no longer needed. Mitigation: (a) offer evening and weekend appointments; (b) employ case managers with lived experience of homelessness or domestic violence who can build authentic trust; (c) frame case management as partnership, not compliance, and allow families to set meeting frequency after month six; (d) provide $25 grocery gift cards for quarterly check-ins to offset transportation and time costs, centering equity for families balancing multiple jobs.\n\n**Risk 2: Landlord Availability**\n\nVacancy rates below 4% mean landlords have many applicants and may reject flexible screening. Mitigation: (a) the Landlord Liaison Program offers financial incentives (holding fees, damage mitigation up to $2,500); (b) we provide same-day rental application support and move-in within 72 hours of approval; (c) case managers maintain post-placement contact with landlords to address concerns before they escalate to eviction; (d) we collect landlord feedback quarterly and adapt communication or support based on their input, recognizing landlords as partners.\n\n**Risk 3: Rent Inflation Outpacing Wages**\n\nIf rents rise 7%+ annually but wages grow only 3%, families cannot sustain housing post-subsidy. Mitigation: (a) prioritize families for Housing Choice Voucher referrals at month 12; (b) extend subsidy duration by three months when inflation exceeds 6%; (c) partner with workforce programs to connect caregivers to jobs paying above minimum wage; (d) use data to advocate with King County Council and state legislators for emergency rental assistance and tenant protections.\n\n**Risk 4: Staff Turnover**\n\nCase manager burnout and turnover disrupt trust and continuity. Mitigation: (a) maintain caseloads at \u226420 families; (b) provide clinical supervision biweekly and trauma-informed care training annually; (c) offer competitive salaries (minimum $62,000 for case managers with benefits); (d) include staff well-being questions in quarterly staff surveys and adjust workload or support based on findings, recognizing that equity for clients depends on equity for staff.\n\n**Beneficiary Voice in Adaptation**\n\nOur 2024 client feedback survey (n=312) revealed that 58% of families wanted text-based communication rather than phone calls. We switched to SMS appointment reminders and check-ins, increasing response rates by 34%. We will continue quarterly pulse surveys (10 questions, $10 gift card incentive) and convene a Family Advisory Council of eight current and former clients who meet quarterly to review data, discuss risks, and recommend program changes. Council members receive $50 stipends per meeting, childcare reimbursement, and translation in Spanish, Somali, and Amharic.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Learning & Measurement\n\n**Indicators by Outcome Level**\n\n*Outputs:*\n- Number of families enrolled (target: 240 annually)\n- Percent placed in permanent housing within 60 days (target: 85%)\n- Average subsidy duration in months (target: 15\u201318)\n- Number of units recruited by Landlord Liaison Program (target: 180 annually)\n\n*Short-Term Outcomes (6\u201312 months):*\n- Percent of heads of household increasing income by \u226515% (target: 70%)\n- Percent reporting reduced housing stress on Family Housing Stability Scale (5-point Likert; target: 80% show \u22651-point improvement)\n- Percent of children maintaining school enrollment without interruption (target: 75%)\n\n*Intermediate Outcomes (1\u20133 years):*\n- Percent of families housed without subsidy at 24 months post-enrollment (target: 75%)\n- Percent reducing rent burden to <50% of income by month 30 (target: 60%)\n- Percent receiving eviction prevention legal aid who avoid eviction (target: 68%, tracked via Northwest Justice Project partnership data)\n\n*Long-Term Outcomes (3\u20135 years):*\n- Percent of families in permanent housing at 60 months (target: 65%)\n- Percent of children enrolled in same school for \u22652 consecutive years (target: 70%)\n- Percent of families with \u2265$500 emergency savings by year 4 (target: 20%)\n\n*Impact (Contribution):*\n- King County family homelessness recidivism rate (baseline 28%; target: 25% by year 5, tracked via KCRHA HMIS)\n- Recidivism rate for Black and Latino families vs. white families (track disparity ratio annually)\n\n**Key Learning Questions**\n\n1. Does subsidy duration (12 vs. 18 months) significantly affect 24-month retention, and does the effect differ by family income source (earned vs. benefits)?\n2. Which case management activities (employment support, benefits navigation, landlord mediation, crisis funds) are most strongly associated with long-term stability?\n3. Do families receiving legal aid within 30 days of a lease violation have better retention than those receiving aid later?\n4. How do families define housing stability, and does our measurement (lease retention, rent burden) align with their priorities?\n\n**Data Sources & Frequency**\n\n- HMIS data: monthly extracts for enrollment, placement, retention, and exits\n- Case management notes: coded quarterly for service type and intensity\n- Income verification: collected at enrollment, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months\n- Family Housing Stability Scale: administered at enrollment, 6 months, 12 months\n- School enrollment records: requested annually with family consent\n- Savings self-report: annual survey at months 12, 24, 36, 48\n- Client feedback survey: quarterly pulse (n=60\u201380) plus annual comprehensive (n=250+)\n- Partner data sharing: quarterly reports from Landlord Liaison Program and Northwest Justice Project\n- Family Advisory Council debrief: quarterly\n\n**Use of Findings**\n\nMonthly output dashboards will inform case manager coaching and landlord recruitment targets. Quarterly outcome reviews will trigger program adaptations\u2014for example, if fewer than 65% of families show income gains at six months, we will add partnerships with workforce programs or increase employment support hours. Annual learning reviews will include all 48 staff, partners, and the Family Advisory Council to interpret trends, identify racial disparities, and adjust strategies. Evaluation staff will produce brief reports (4\u20136 pages, plain language, infographics) for KCRHA system performance meetings and joint advocacy efforts. If external factors (e.g., rent inflation, voucher waitlists) worsen, we will escalate to executive leadership for funding or policy advocacy within 30 days.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Boundaries & Sustainability\n\n**What This Program Will NOT Do**\n\nKeys to Stability will not provide permanent subsidies (families transition to vouchers or unsubsidized housing), develop or manage affordable housing units (we rely on private landlords and public housing authorities), offer clinical mental health or substance use treatment (we refer to county behavioral health services), or serve unaccompanied adults or youth (program scope is families with minor children). We also will not substitute for systemic solutions; rapid re-housing is a bridge intervention, not a replacement for living wages, affordable housing production, or anti-discrimination enforcement.\n\n**Sustainability Assumptions**\n\nFinancial sustainability depends on continued federal (HUD Continuum of Care, Emergency Solutions Grant) and local (King County Best Starts for Kids, Seattle Housing Levy) funding streams, which require annual applications and performance reporting. Operational sustainability requires retaining 48 qualified staff in a competitive labor market, maintaining technology systems (HMIS, case management software), and sustaining trust-based partnerships with KCRHA, Landlord Liaison Program, and Northwest Justice Project.\n\n**Ecosystem Change for Lasting Impact**\n\nFor impact to persist beyond direct services, King County must adopt policies that prevent homelessness upstream: Just Cause eviction protections, source-of-income anti-discrimination enforcement, emergency rental assistance as an entitlement for families below 30% AMI, and increased Housing Choice Voucher allocations. The affordable housing production pipeline must deliver at least 1,500 units annually affordable to families at or below 30% AMI. Our data, client stories, and partnership with KCRHA position us to advocate for these changes, but we cannot achieve population-level impact alone.\n\n---\n\n**Monica Patel, Senior Director of Impact**  \n**November 2, 2025**\n\n---\n\n## 9.
