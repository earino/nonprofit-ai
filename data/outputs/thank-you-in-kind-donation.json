Your commitment to supporting our mission, particularly through the Hurricane Readiness Initiative 2025, is deeply appreciated.\n\nThe 500 foldable cots, 1,200 thermal blankets, 18 Honda EU2200i portable generators, and 60 rechargeable LED lanterns you provided are invaluable. These critical items will be immediately integrated into our emergency preparedness inventory, ensuring we can swiftly provide comfort and safety to individuals and families displaced by future storms. The generators will power essential operations at our temporary shelters, while the cots, blankets, and lanterns will provide much-needed warmth, rest, and light during challenging times.\n\nYour thoughtful contribution, with an estimated fair market value of $86,400, is a testament to your compassion and understanding of the immediate needs of our community. We want to emphasize that non-monetary gifts like yours are just as vital as financial contributions, directly enabling us to deliver essential services and make a tangible difference in people's lives. Your proactive support significantly strengthens our operational capacity and allows us to be fully prepared when disaster strikes.\n\nWe are so grateful for your partnership. Your generosity truly embodies the spirit of community resilience. We would be delighted to arrange a time for you to see these vital supplies in action, perhaps during an upcoming readiness drill or deployment, if you are ever in the area.\n\nPlease find enclosed your formal tax receipt for this donation.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\n\nAlicia Chen\nChief Development Officer\nGulf Coast Relief Alliance",
