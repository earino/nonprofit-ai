      "content": "The Cumberland Mobile Market & Nutrition Coaching program addresses food insecurity and promotes health equity by providing fresh, affordable produce and tailored nutrition education to rural communities in Harlan and Letcher Counties, Kentucky. These counties face significant challenges, including a 28% poverty rate and limited access to grocery stores, making them critical food deserts. Many residents, often relying on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, also encounter high transportation barriers and difficulty with benefit recertification.\n\nThis program targets 320 unduplicated low-income households, seniors, and families with children across Harlan and Letcher Counties. Our core services include a mobile market delivering fresh produce and comprehensive nutrition coaching. The Mobile Market operates two days per month from March to November, making 18 market stops and distributing 35,000 pounds of fresh produce annually. We offer group nutrition classes monthly at three rotating sites, providing six-session cycles (18 classes total), alongside optional 1:1 coaching sessions (three 30-minute sessions over three months per household). We also assist with 120 SNAP applications/recertifications.\n\nOur model is grounded in the USDA SNAP-Ed Toolkit, specifically its Healthy Food Pantry Strategies and Retail Environment Change approaches, and evidence from produce prescription programs (Wholesome Wave; JAMA Netw Open 2019). We adapt these strategies to address mountainous terrain, limited grocery stores, and low car ownership, which exacerbate food access issues. The small team, comprising a Program Coordinator (0.8 FTE), Mobile Market Driver/Logistics Lead (0.6 FTE), Nutrition Educator (0.4 FTE), and Data & Outreach Assistant (0.2 FTE), leverages local partnerships with the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension\u2014Harlan County, Appalachian Regional Healthcare\u2014Harlan, Harlan County Schools Family Resource Centers, and St. Mary\u2019s Episcopal Church.\n\nWe measure success by tracking key outputs and outcomes. Outputs include serving 320 unduplicated residents, hosting 18 mobile market days, distributing 35,000 pounds of fresh produce, delivering 18 nutrition classes, completing 120 SNAP application/recertification assists, and providing 150 coaching sessions. Outcomes focus on increased household food security (target: +15 percentage points of participants moving from very low/low to marginal/secure, measured by USDA 6-Item Food Security Module pre/post), increased daily fruit/vegetable consumption (target: 1 daily serving increase), increased SNAP uptake (target: 90 of 120 assists), and improved confidence in meal planning on a budget. We use Link2Feed for intake and service logs, class sign-in sheets, and partner referral logs for data collection.\n\nCumberland Roots Collective has three years of experience operating a community pantry and garden and successfully piloted two pop-up markets in 2023, serving 180 residents. Our staff are local, possess lived experience, and receive Extension training. We utilize Link2Feed, Google Workspace, Square POS with EBT, and Route4Me for efficient operations, ensuring program fidelity and accessibility.

Many households face broadband limitations that hinder SNAP recertification, while transportation costs prevent regular trips to distant supermarkets.\n\n**Target Population:** The program serves 320 unduplicated low-income households, seniors, and families with children in Harlan and Letcher Counties\u2014many are SNAP-eligible or currently receiving benefits and experience high transportation barriers. Participants include a mix of older adults managing chronic disease and young families stretching limited budgets.\n\n**Services:** Core activities include (1) mobile fresh produce markets accepting SNAP/EBT and offering subsidized prices; (2) monthly group nutrition classes teaching meal planning, food budgeting, and simple cooking; (3) optional one-on-one coaching (three 30-minute sessions over three months per household); and (4) on-site SNAP application and recertification assistance.\n\n**Model:** The program is grounded in USDA SNAP-Ed Toolkit strategies (Healthy Food Pantry, Retail Environment Change) and produce prescription evidence (Wholesome Wave; *JAMA Network Open* 2019), adapted for multi-generational participants and low-technology settings through paper intake, phone follow-up, and culturally relevant Appalachian recipes.\n\n**Frequency & Duration:** The Mobile Market operates two days per month, March through November (18 market days total). Group nutrition classes run monthly at three rotating sites (60 minutes each, six-session cycle per site; 18 classes total). Optional one-on-one coaching provides three sessions over three months per household.\n\n**Settings:** Services rotate among Cumberland Senior Center, Lynch Black Lung Association Hall, Harlan County Public Library (Cawood), and St. Mary's Episcopal Church (Middlesboro hub).\n\n**Outputs & Outcomes:** The program will serve 320 unduplicated residents; host 18 mobile market days; distribute 35,000 pounds of fresh produce; deliver 18 nutrition classes; complete 120 SNAP application/recertification assists; and provide 150 coaching sessions. Anticipated outcomes include increased household food security (target: +15 percentage points moving from very low/low to marginal/secure on USDA 6-Item Food Security Module pre/post); average increase of one daily serving of fruits/vegetables; SNAP approvals for 90 of 120 assists (75% approval rate); and 75% attendance/retention in six-session classes. Measurement tools include Link2Feed intake and service logs, USDA Food Security Module administered pre/post, class sign-in sheets, SNAP application tracking via Benefits.gov confirmation and partner follow-up, and monthly partner referral logs.\n\n**Capacity & Equity:** Cumberland Roots Collective has operated a community pantry and garden for three years and piloted two pop-up markets in 2023 serving 180 residents. Staff (2.0 FTE total: Program Coordinator 0.8 FTE, Mobile Market Driver/Logistics Lead 0.6 FTE, Nutrition Educator 0.4 FTE, Data & Outreach Assistant 0.2 FTE) are local residents with lived experience and University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension training. The Nutrition Educator maintains a 1:20 class ratio and 1:50 household coaching caseload; the Mobile Market serves 75 households per route day. Partners include University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension\u2014Harlan County; Appalachian Regional Healthcare\u2014Harlan; Harlan County Schools Family Resource Centers; and St. Mary's Episcopal Church.

In Gulfton, Alief, and East End\u2014neighborhoods where 60% of residents are foreign-born\u2014median household income is $38,000, 22% below the citywide average. Employers report difficulty filling 1,800+ annual help desk openings while skilled immigrants remain underemployed due to unrecognized foreign credentials, limited professional networks, and gaps in U.S. workplace norms.\n\n## Who We Serve\n\nBridgeWorks serves 350 work-authorized immigrants and refugees ages 18\u201335 in Gulfton, Alief, and East End. Participants have intermediate English proficiency, are underemployed or seeking career advancement, and many hold foreign credentials in unrelated fields. Primary languages include Spanish, Arabic, Dari, and Vietnamese.\n\n## What Participants Receive\n\nEach cohort delivers:\n- 96 hours of CompTIA A+ technical training (8 hours weekly for 12 weeks)\n- 24 hours of contextualized English for IT professionals (2 hours weekly)\n- Twice-monthly one-on-one career coaching for up to six months\n- Weekly 90-minute job club for 12 weeks post-training\n- Digital literacy assessment and remediation\n- Mock interviews with employer partners\n- Job placement assistance and retention support\n\n## How the Model Works\n\nBridgeWorks is grounded in sectoral training and Integrated Education and Training (IET), following MDRC's WorkAdvance and National Skills Coalition IET frameworks. We pair CompTIA Tech Career Academy industry-standard curriculum with workplace English instruction, contextualized to IT scenarios. Career coaches maintain 1:40 ratios; technical instructors teach at 1:20 in lab settings. The Employer Engagement Manager cultivates partnerships supporting 1:50 active job seekers through site visits, hiring events, and customized pre-screening.\n\n## When Services Occur\n\nWe run four 12-week cohorts annually. Classes meet evenings and Saturdays to accommodate work schedules. Coaching continues biweekly for six months post-enrollment; job club runs weekly during weeks 13\u201324.\n\n## Where Services Are Delivered\n\nTraining occurs at Gulfton community center and Alief satellite sites; hands-on labs operate at Houston Community College Southwest campus. Mock interviews and employer events happen citywide based on partner locations.\n\n## Partners and Capacity\n\nHouston Community College Southwest provides lab space and adjunct instructors. BakerRipley and World Relief Texas refer participants and offer wraparound supports. CompTIA Tech Career Academy supplies curriculum and certification vouchers. Employer partners\u2014including AIG Houston Technology Center and City of Houston Information Technology Services\u2014host site visits, conduct mock interviews, and post openings.\n\nHIAC operates with 6.5 full-time equivalent staff: Program Director (1.0), Career Coaches (2.0), Technical Instructor (1.0), Employer Engagement Manager (1.0), Digital Literacy Instructor (0.5), Data and Evaluation Specialist (0.5), and Case Manager (0.5). The organization has delivered workforce programs for 10 years, placing 1,200 immigrants in healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. A 2023 tech pilot placed 60 graduates with 78% 90-day retention, demonstrating sector capacity.\n\n## Outputs and Outcomes\n\n**Annual targets:**\n- Enroll 350 participants\n- 300 complete training (85% completion rate)\n- 240 earn CompTIA A+ certification (80% pass rate)\n- 210 placed in IT or help desk roles at $17+ per hour (70% placement rate)\n- 158 retain employment 90 days (75% retention rate)\n- Average starting wage: $18 per hour\n- 24 employer information sessions\n- 60 employers engaged\n\n**Measurement:** Attendance logs; Moodle learning management system (LMS) exports; CompTIA certification verification; Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) case and placement records; pre- and post-program Northstar Digital Literacy assessments; wage verification via paystubs and employer memoranda of understanding (MOUs). The Data and Evaluation Specialist generates quarterly dashboards tracking skills gains, certification attainment, sector-aligned employment, wage increases, and job retention.\n\n## Equity and Access\n\nLanguage access includes bilingual coaches (Spanish, Arabic, Dari, Vietnamese) and translated materials. Classes are ADA-accessible; we provide assistive technology and accommodate learning differences. Metro bus passes reduce transportation barriers. Outreach occurs through refugee resettlement agencies, ethnic community-based organizations, public libraries, and faith networks. Child care referrals connect families to subsidized slots; evening and weekend schedules accommodate caregiving. Case management addresses housing instability, legal status documentation, and credential evaluation\u2014barriers common among Houston's immigrant workforce.\n\nBridgeWorks directly advances **Comerica Bank Foundation's priorities in skills training, career pathways, and economic mobility**, equipping underserved communities with industry-recognized credentials that unlock family-sustaining wages in Houston's growing technology sector.",

Chicago youth face significant mental health challenges; 27% of Chicago Public School (CPS) students reported feeling sad or hopeless most days in the past year, and access to care remains a critical barrier, particularly for South and West Side communities. Our program serves 1,200 students in grades 6-12 across 10 Chicago Public Schools in Englewood, North Lawndale, Little Village, and Austin. This population is predominantly Black and Latino, with 85% low-income statuses and many experiencing trauma exposure.\n\nSchoolWell offers a tiered approach: monthly 45-minute Social Emotional Learning (SEL) workshops (Tier 1), weekly 60-minute group therapy for 12 weeks (Tier 2), and weekly 50-minute individual therapy for up to 16 sessions (Tier 3), alongside 24-hour crisis response services. These services run from September through June. Our approach is grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Trauma-Focused CBT, aligns with CASEL's SEL framework, and utilizes a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) alongside Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocols. Evidence from SAMHSA and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network informs our practices, adapted to address community violence, bilingual needs, and stigma within these neighborhoods.\n\nWe operate within on-campus wellness rooms, with telehealth options available. We will screen 1,200 students, deliver 8,000 Tier 1 encounters, enroll 300 students in Tier 2 groups, provide individual therapy to 250 students, and engage 400 caregivers through 10 professional development sessions for school staff. We measure impact through reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, improved coping skills, and decreased chronic absenteeism among participants. Our target outcomes include a 3-point mean reduction in PHQ-A and GAD-7 scores, a 20% gain in Coping Skills Inventory scores, and a 3-percentage point increase in attendance for Tier 2/3 participants.

In these neighborhoods, 42% of adolescents report symptoms of depression or anxiety, yet only 28% access treatment due to clinician shortages, transportation barriers, and stigma. Embedding care in schools addresses these access gaps.\n\n**Who we serve:** 1,200 students attending CPS schools in target communities; 85% qualify for free or reduced lunch; predominantly Black and Latino; many have experienced trauma; significant numbers require bilingual Spanish/English services.\n\n**What we deliver:** A Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS). Tier 1: classroom Social Emotional Learning (SEL) workshops aligned to CASEL standards reach all students. Tier 2: weekly skill-building groups support students with emerging needs. Tier 3: individual therapy addresses clinical-level symptoms. Crisis response activates within 24 hours. Caregiver education sessions build family capacity.\n\n**How we work:** All interventions are grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Trauma-Focused CBT, adapted for culturally diverse adolescents per SAMHSA and National Child Traumatic Stress Network guidance. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocols identify needs early. Bilingual staff and translated materials ensure language access; on-campus wellness rooms eliminate transportation barriers; partnerships with Chicago Public Schools Office of Student Health & Wellness, Sinai Chicago, Enlace Chicago, UCAN, and NAMI Chicago extend support beyond school walls.\n\n**When services occur:** September through June. Tier 1: 45-minute monthly workshops (8 sessions annually). Tier 2: 60-minute weekly groups for 12 weeks. Tier 3: 50-minute weekly sessions up to 16 visits. Staff ratios ensure quality: 1:25 therapist caseload, 1:10 group facilitator.\n\n**Where:** On-site wellness rooms in partner schools; telehealth via encrypted Zoom for Healthcare when needed.\n\n**Outputs and outcomes:** Screen 1,200 students; deliver 8,000 Tier 1 encounters; enroll 300 in Tier 2 groups; provide therapy to 250; reach 400 caregivers; train school staff (10 sessions). Outcomes measured via validated PHQ-A and GAD-7 scales (target: 3-point mean reduction), Coping Skills Inventory (+20% gain), and CPS Aspen attendance data (3-percentage-point improvement among participants). All tracked through Credible EHR, REDCap surveys, and Tableau dashboards per Chicago Data Collaborative standards.\n\n**Organizational capacity:** Lakeshore Youth Services has delivered school-based behavioral health for 15 years across 22 schools; Joint Commission accredited; completed Trust-funded external evaluation in 2022. Our 18.0 FTE team includes a Program Director, 2 Clinical Supervisors, 12 Licensed Clinical Social Workers, 2 Community Health Workers, and dedicated data/training staff\u2014structured to sustain quality, equity, and data-driven continuous improvement aligned with The Chicago Community Trust's commitment to youth mental health and racial equity.",
