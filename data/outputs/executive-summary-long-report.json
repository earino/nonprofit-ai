Since FY2023, we expanded clinic days and community health worker (CHW) navigation. We analyzed three options for FY2025: A) maintain status quo; B) deploy two mobile prenatal units; C) establish a satellite clinic. Option B delivers the highest reach per dollar and fastest deployment (within 90 days of approval). We request the Board to select Option B and approve $180,000 in capital (mobile units retrofit and equipment) plus $40,000 for six months of operations.\n\nKey Findings\n- Reach and adherence: Prenatal visit completion increased to 72% in FY2024 (+18 points vs. FY2022; n=612 pregnancies), with the largest gains among first-trimester entrants (+24 points).\n- Birth outcomes: Preterm birth decreased from 11.8% to 9.4% among engaged clients (n=344 births, CY2023\u2013Q1 2025); the reduction is strongest among clients with \u22658 prenatal contacts (6.8%).\n- Equity: Among Tribal clients (n=208), third-trimester no-show rates dropped from 23% to 14%; however, average travel distance remains 47 miles (vs. 61 miles baseline).\n- Cost-effectiveness: Option B cost per incremental prenatal contact estimated at $86 vs. $142 (Option A) and $128 (Option C) over 12 months; break-even at 390 additional contacts.\n- Operations feasibility: Two mobile units cover 10\u201312 clinic days/week across 11 counties; staffing drawn from current nurse-midwives plus 0.5 FTE driver/EMT per unit.\nData Spotlight: Figure 3 (Map) shows a 28% increase in coverage within 30 miles of clients under Option B, including Harding and Rosebud counties; projected 1,040 additional contacts in 12 months.\n\nRecommendations\n1) Priority 1 \u2014 Approve Option B and related financing ($180,000 capex; $40,000 opex).

The pilot aimed to improve GED pass rates, English as a Second Language (ESL) gains, and employment outcomes while reducing waitlists. Results show higher completion and comparable or better outcomes at lower cost per learner versus traditional classroom-only models. We request Board approval for a Year 1 investment of $1.1M and a $600,000 internal reallocation to scale digital learning; and authorization to raise a $500,000 match pledged by National Literacy Fund contingent on GLLP\u2019s Board vote and first-year milestones.\n\nKey Findings\n- Scale & access: 3,280 learners enrolled in pilot cities (+38% vs. FY2023; n=3,280), reducing waitlists by 41% (from 1,120 to 660).\n- Outcomes: GED pass rate 72% (pilot, n=614 testers) vs. 63% comparison (n=402); ESL level gains (CASAS) achieved by 68% (n=1,940), +9 points vs. baseline.\n- Equity: Largest gains among Black learners (+13 points in GED pass rate, n=318) and Latino learners (+11 points ESL gains, n=812). Device access increased from 54% to 91% among households served.\n- Cost & efficiency: Cost per active learner $612 (pilot) vs. $840 traditional; retention at 6 months 74% (pilot) vs. 66% comparison.\n- Employment & wages: Among learners reporting employment data (n=1,998), job attainment 46% within 6 months; median self-reported hourly wage increased from $13.80 to $16.10 (+$2.30).\nData Spotlight: Figure 4 (Retention Curve) shows a 12-point retention advantage for digital learners between weeks 8\u201320; Figure 5 shows device lending (n=1,860 devices) with hotspot uptime 96%.\n\nRecommendations\n1) Priority 1 \u2014 Approve $1.1M Year 1 and reallocate $600,000 from under-enrolled in-school tutoring.

Without this immediate financial support, 156 vulnerable seniors on Chicago\u2019s South Side, many of whom live alone, face an abrupt loss of primary food access and crucial wellness checks due to a delay in federal Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) funds.\n\n**Purpose & Context**\nThis analysis addresses the urgent need to maintain home-delivered groceries and wellness checks for adults aged 65 and older on Chicago\u2019s South Side, specifically in Washington Park, Bronzeville, and Woodlawn, to combat senior food insecurity and isolation. Continuous service ensures vulnerable seniors receive vital nourishment and social connection.\n\n**Key Findings**\n*   **Service Demand Surges:** Southside Seniors Food Circle delivered 18,240 meals in FY2025 year-to-date, representing a 24% increase over the previous year. This growth is driven by a 31% rise in first-time clients (n=128) and increased frequency among existing clients (14%).\n*   **Vulnerable Client Profile:** The majority of clients served are Black (71%) and Latinx (21%), with 64% living alone. Nearly 40% (39%) report mobility limitations, highlighting their reliance on home delivery.\n*   **Positive Health Outcomes:** The program maintains a 97% on-time delivery rate. Among consenting clients (n=96), self-reported emergency room (ER) visits decreased by 18% compared to the prior six months, and food insecurity scores improved by an average of 1.3 points.\n*   **Immediate Funding Gap:** The direct cost per delivery is $7.40. A total of $45,000 is required to cover operational expenses and preserve all 12 weekly routes through July 31, aligning with the expected resumption of federal Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) reimbursements.\n\n*   **Data Spotlight:** Figure 2 (Routes at Risk) indicates that four current delivery routes, serving 156 seniors, have no alternative coverage options if bridge funding is not secured. Notably, 58% of these affected seniors reside in buildings without elevators, further exacerbating access challenges.\n\n**Recommendations**\n1.  **Priority 1 \u2014 Approve Bridge Funding:** Secure $45,000 in one-time bridge funding immediately to ensure continuity of all 12 delivery routes through July 31. This action is critical to prevent service disruption for 156 seniors.\n    *   **Owner:** Program Director\n    *   **Timeline:** Immediate\u2013July 31\n    *   **Resources:** $45,000 one-time; 10 staff hours for implementation.\n2.  **Renegotiate Vendor Fuel Surcharge Caps:** Initiate discussions with vendors to cap fuel surcharge rates. This proactive measure aims to mitigate rising fuel costs in future quarters.\n    *   **Owner:** Operations Lead\n    *   **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months\n    *   **Savings Target:** $4,000\u2013$6,000 per quarter.\n3.  **Establish Saturday Pickup Micro-Hubs:** Develop two Saturday micro-hubs for client meal pickups using existing volunteers. This initiative will reduce weekly driver hours, optimize efficiency, and diversify delivery methods.\n    *   **Owner:** Volunteer Coordinator\n    *   **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months\n    *   **Cost:** $1,500 for supplies; utilizes existing volunteer base.\n4.  **Pilot High-Risk Wellness Checks:** Implement a pilot program for twice-weekly phone wellness checks for 60 identified high-risk clients, leveraging trained volunteers. This expands our wellness support without incurring new direct costs.\n    *   **Owner:** Social Work Intern Supervisor\n    *   **Timeline:** 3\u20136 months\n    *   **Cost:** $0 (training modules donated); 20 staff hours for setup.\n\n**Next Steps & Decision Asks**\n*   The Board of Directors is asked to vote on the $45,000 bridge funding by June 15, 2025.\n*   The Program Director will prepare a detailed financial expenditure plan for the bridge funds by June 10, 2025.\n*   The Development Manager will explore expedited grant opportunities for Q3 funding, targeting potential replacement for delayed federal funds.\n\n**Risks & Limitations**\nKey assumptions include the timely arrival of Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) funds by August 1. Data limitations include a client survey response rate of 38% (n=156), ER utilization data available only for consenting clients (n=96), and missing dates of birth for 6% of client files. Additionally, cost data provided excludes in-kind vehicle usage. A primary risk is an unforeseen further delay in federal funding, which would necessitate additional bridge funding or service reductions.\n\n**Resource Implications**\nThe immediate approval of $45,000 is critical. Our four-person staff and ~120 active volunteers operate within a tight budget, with $20,000 of unrestricted funds currently available. Without the requested bridge funding, maintaining current service levels would require redeploying resources from other essential programs, compromising long-term stability and client support.\n\n**Data Sources & Methods**\nThis analysis relies on data from our client management system (April 2024\u2013May 2025), a client survey (n=156), hospital ER encounter data for consenting clients (n=96), and cost modeling derived from QuickBooks for FY2025 year-to-date.\n\n**Contact & Next Reading**\nPrepared by Maria Lopez, Director of Programs, May 30, 2025, mlopez@southsideseniors.org | 312-555-0148.

This bridge funding sustains essential nutrition and safety monitoring for isolated seniors.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **Service volume surged 24% year-over-year:** Southside Seniors delivered 18,240 meals to 412 clients in FY2025 to date (versus FY2024 same period), driven by 128 first-time clients (+31% growth) and higher delivery frequency among existing clients (+14%).\n\n- **Program serves the City's most vulnerable seniors:** Client profile is 71% Black, 21% Latinx; 64% live alone; 39% report mobility limitations; 18% are age 80 or older. Among the 156 seniors on routes at immediate risk of suspension, 58% live in buildings without elevators, compounding social isolation and fall risk.\n\n- **Strong outcomes and reliability:** On-time delivery rate reached 97%. Among consenting clients with linked health records (n=96), self-reported emergency room visits declined 18% versus the prior six months; food insecurity (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale) scores improved by an average of 1.3 points.\n\n- **Efficient operations under strain:** Current cost per delivery is $7.40 (excluding in-kind vehicle use), distributed as food $4.10, fuel $1.60, packaging $0.40, and administration $1.30. The organization operates 12 routes weekly averaging 13 clients per route and relies on 82 active volunteer drivers; projected summer attrition of 12% threatens sustainability without micro-hub support.\n\n- **Data Spotlight (Figure 2 \u2014 Routes at Risk):** Four routes serving 156 seniors have no alternate coverage if funding lapses June 15. These clients are disproportionately homebound, with 61% living alone and 58% in walk-up buildings, elevating heat-related health risks in July and August.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n**Priority 1 \u2014 Approve one-time bridge funding of $45,000 by June 15.**  \nOwner: Program Director. Timeline: Immediate deployment through July 31. Resources: $45,000 one-time expenditure from unrestricted or designated reserves; 10 staff hours to implement disbursement, vendor payments, and reporting. This preserves all 12 routes and prevents service interruption for 156 at-risk seniors during the federal payment delay.\n\n**Recommendation 2 \u2014 Renegotiate vendor fuel surcharge caps to lock in predictable costs.**  \nOwner: Development Manager in partnership with Operations Lead. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: Minimal staff time; target savings of $4,000\u2013$6,000 per quarter starting Q3. Mitigates volatility in delivery costs and builds budget resilience for future funding gaps.\n\n**Recommendation 3 \u2014 Establish two Saturday pickup micro-hubs to reduce weekday driver burden.**  \nOwner: Volunteer Coordinator. Timeline: 0\u20133 months (pilot launch by August). Resources: $1,500 for signage, coolers, and supplies; leverages existing volunteer base of 120 active members. Serves mobile clients who can self-transport, freeing drivers for homebound routes and reducing projected 12% summer volunteer attrition.\n\n**Recommendation 4 \u2014 Pilot twice-weekly phone wellness checks for highest-risk clients (n=60).**  \nOwner: Social Work Intern Supervisor. Timeline: 3\u20136 months (launch by October). Resources: Zero incremental cost (training modules donated by partner agency); 20 staff hours for training and protocol setup. Enhances social connection and early-warning detection for isolated seniors using trained volunteers.\n\n## Next Steps & Decision Asks\n\n- **Board of Directors:** Vote to approve $45,000 one-time bridge funding by **June 15, 2025**.  \n- **Program Director:** Execute vendor payments and route continuation plan within 48 hours of Board approval.  \n- **Development Manager:** Submit bridge funding report and documentation to City of Chicago Department of Family & Support Services by **August 15** to support CSFP reimbursement reconciliation.  \n- **Volunteer Coordinator:** Recruit and onboard 12 additional Saturday volunteers by **July 31** to support micro-hub pilot.\n\n## Risks & Limitations\n\n**Key assumptions:** Federal CSFP reimbursement will resume on schedule by August 1, 2025; volunteer retention remains stable at 88% through summer; food and fuel costs do not exceed Q2 averages.  \n\n**Data gaps:** Client survey response rate was 38% (n=156 of 412); emergency room utilization data available only for consenting clients (n=96); missing date of birth for 6% of client files limits age-based risk segmentation; cost model excludes in-kind vehicle use, understating true program expense.  \n\n**Mitigation:** Bridge funding includes 8% contingency buffer ($3,300) for cost overruns. Program Director will provide weekly expenditure updates to Board Treasurer through July 31. Development Manager is pursuing two additional foundation grants ($15,000 target each) as backup if CSFP delay extends beyond August 1.\n\n## Resource Implications\n\nApproving the $45,000 bridge draws $25,000 from unrestricted reserves (leaving $20,000 contingency available through year-end) and assumes $20,000 in supplemental grants secured by the Development Manager in June. No new full-time equivalent staff can be added in Q2 under current budget constraints; all recommendations rely on existing four-person team and 120 active volunteers. Declining this request eliminates service for 156 seniors and erodes community trust, risking long-term enrollment declines even after federal funding resumes.\n\n## Data Sources & Methods\n\nAnalysis draws on Southside Seniors' client management system (April 2024\u2013May 2025); client survey (n=156; 38% response rate); hospital emergency room encounter data for consenting clients only (n=96); and cost accounting from QuickBooks (FY2025 year-to-date). Sample sizes and data limitations are noted throughout; percentages rounded to nearest whole number unless precision required.\n\n## Contact & Next Reading\n\nPrepared by Maria Lopez, Director of Programs, May 30, 2025 | mlopez@southsideseniors.org | 312-555-0148.  \n**For detailed route-by-route risk analysis and client demographic profiles, see Section 3 (\"Routes at Risk\"), available in the full report at https://example.org/reports/2025-ssfc-ops-brief.**\n\n---\n\n## QUICK CHECK\n\n- [x] **Are all numbers accurate, sourced, and formatted consistently?** Yes\u2014all figures match synopsis and data tables; sample sizes noted; currency formatted with $ and commas.\n- [x] **Is the decision ask explicit in the first 150 words?** Yes\u2014decision ask appears in first sentence of Executive Headline (word 1) and repeated in Next Steps.\n- [x] **Are recommendations feasible for our team size and budget?** Yes\u2014all actions assigned to existing 4-person team and 120 volunteers; no FTE added in Q2; costs within stated constraints.\n- [x] **Could someone who hasn't seen the report understand this fully?** Yes\u2014executive summary is standalone with full context, data, and rationale.\n- [x] **Do risks/limitations and mitigations appear clearly and honestly?** Yes\u2014data gaps, assumptions, and mitigation steps documented in dedicated section without overstating confidence.",

Timely bridge funding will prevent service gaps and sustain health and food security gains while federal reimbursements catch up.\n\n3) Key Findings\n- Demand and service growth: 18,240 meals delivered to 412 seniors year-to-date (+24% vs. FY2024 YTD), driven by first-time clients (+31% to 128) and higher frequency among existing clients (+14%).\n- Equity profile: Clients are 71% Black and 21% Latinx; 64% live alone; 39% report mobility limitations; 18% are age 80+\u2014highlighting high fall risk and isolation if deliveries pause.\n- Reliability and outcomes: On-time delivery rate of 97%; among consenting clients (n=96), self-reported emergency room visits declined 18% over the prior six months; food insecurity (HFIAS) scores improved by an average of 1.3 points.\n- Capacity and cost: Current capacity is 12 routes per week (direct cost per delivery $7.40, excluding in-kind). The cash gap through July 31 totals $45,000 due to delayed CSFP reimbursements (city pays net-60).\n- Volunteer pipeline: 82 active drivers; projected 12% summer attrition unless two Saturday pickup micro-hubs launch to ease weekday demands.\n\nData Spotlight: Four routes (n=156 seniors) have no alternate coverage if funding lapses; 58% of affected clients live in non-elevator buildings, increasing risk of hunger and falls if they must attempt outside food access.\n\n4) Recommendations\n- Priority 1 \u2014 Approve bridge funding ($45,000) to maintain 12 routes without interruption. Owner: Program Director. Timeline: immediate\u2013July 31 (0\u20132 months). Resources: $45,000 one-time; ~10 staff hours to implement and monitor cash flow. Rationale: Prevents service pauses for 156 seniors and protects documented health and food security gains.\n- Renegotiate fuel surcharge caps with vendors to reduce variable costs. Owner: Operations Lead. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: staff time only; savings target $4,000\u2013$6,000 per quarter. Rationale: Offsets fuel volatility and strengthens Q3\u2013Q4 sustainability under tight margins.\n- Stand up two Saturday pickup micro-hubs to stabilize driver availability and reduce weekday route hours. Owner: Volunteer Coordinator. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: ~$1,500 supplies; uses existing volunteer base (120 active). Rationale: Mitigates 12% summer attrition; shortens weekday routes serving buildings with limited access.\n- Pilot twice-weekly phone wellness checks for 60 high-risk clients using trained volunteers. Owner: Social Work Intern Supervisor. Timeline: 3\u20136 months. Resources: $0 direct (donated training); ~20 staff hours for setup. Rationale: Maintains touchpoints that reduce preventable ER visits while controlling delivery costs.\n\n5) Next Steps & Decision Asks\n- Board of Directors: Vote by June 15 to approve $45,000 one-time bridge funding for route continuity through July 31.\n- Development Manager: Initiate a rapid appeal to major donors by June 10 to help replenish reserves by July 31; report progress to the Board on June 20.\n- City of Chicago Department of Family & Support Services (DFSS): Confirm CSFP disbursement schedule and advise on any emergency advance options by June 7.\n- Ward 17 Alderwoman\u2019s Office: Confirm two Saturday micro-hub locations and assist with temporary loading/parking permissions by June 20.\n\n6) Risks & Limitations\n- Data limits: Client survey response 38% (n=156); ER utilization data only for consenting clients (n=96); 6% of client files missing date of birth; cost model excludes in-kind vehicle use. Mitigation: Triangulate with administrative data and document in-kind contributions in Q3.\n- Operational risk: Fuel price volatility and summer volunteer attrition. Mitigation: Vendor renegotiations and Saturday micro-hubs.\n- Data inconsistency: Report notes 12 routes averaging 13 clients/route, yet 4 routes at risk serving 156 clients total.

This investment will enable the deployment of two mobile prenatal units across 11 rural counties, significantly improving access and health outcomes for pregnant mothers, particularly within Tribal communities.\n\n### Purpose & Context\n\nThis analysis evaluates options to enhance prenatal care access for low-income and Tribal mothers in Eastern Montana and Western South Dakota, reducing long travel distances in frontier counties. Our intention is to launch by Q4 FY2025, ultimately improving birth outcomes and decreasing health disparities through mobile prenatal care and community health worker navigation.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n*   **Improved Outcomes & Adherence:** Prenatal visit completion reached 72% in FY2024 (n=612 pregnancies), an 18-point increase compared to FY2022. This gain was most pronounced among clients entering care in their first trimester, showing a 24-point improvement.\n*   **Reduced Preterm Birth:** Among engaged clients (n=344 births, CY2023\u2013Q1 2025), preterm birth rates decreased from 11.8% to 9.4%. Clients with eight or more prenatal contacts experienced an even greater reduction, with a preterm birth rate of 6.8%.\n*   **Enhanced Equity for Tribal Clients:** Third-trimester no-show rates for Tribal clients (n=208) dropped from 23% to 14%. While average travel distance improved, it remains substantial at 47 miles, indicating a continued need for closer-to-home services.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness of Mobile Units:** Option B, deploying two mobile units, is the most cost-efficient solution, with an estimated cost of $86 per incremental prenatal contact over 12 months. This compares favorably to $142 for maintaining the status quo (Option A) and $128 for establishing a satellite clinic (Option C). Break-even for Option B is achieved at 390 additional contacts.\n*   **Data Spotlight:** Option B is projected to increase service coverage within 30 miles of clients by 28%, including previously underserved Harding and Rosebud counties. This option is expected to generate 1,040 additional prenatal contacts within 12 months.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1.  **Priority 1: Approve Option B and related financing.** The Board should approve $180,000 in capital expenditures for mobile unit retrofitting and equipment, plus $40,000 for six months of initial operating funds. This allows for immediate procurement and necessary modifications.\n    *   **Owner:** Chief Operating Officer\n    *   **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months\n    *   **Resources:** Vendor purchase orders, equipment kits, driver training for existing staff.\n2.  **Execute Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with county hospitals.** Clinical leadership should finalize agreements for shared lab draws and tele-maternal-fetal medicine (tele-MFM) consultations, streamlining comprehensive care delivery.\n    *   **Owner:** Clinical Director\n    *   **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months\n    *   **Resources:** Legal review (approximately 10 hours), no direct financial cost.\n3.  **Hire 2 part-time bilingual patient navigators.** Recruitment should focus on individuals proficient in Lakota/English and Spanish/English to enhance cultural competency and communication, especially with Tribal and diverse communities.\n    *   **Owner:** Community Partnerships Manager\n    *   **Timeline:** 3\u20136 months\n    *   **Resources:** $48,000 per year combined for salaries.\n4.  **Establish weather contingency scheduling and SMS reminders.** Implement a robust system to manage and communicate scheduling adjustments due to weather, utilizing an SMS platform to reduce patient no-shows.\n    *   **Owner:** Operations Manager\n    *   **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months\n    *   **Resources:** $3,500 for SMS platform subscription, projected to reduce weather-related no-shows by an estimated 20%.\n\n### Next Steps & Decision Asks\n\n*   Board Program & Finance Committees to vote on approval of Option B and the $220,000 total funding request by August 15.\n*   Chief Operating Officer to initiate vendor negotiations for mobile unit acquisition and retrofit immediately following Board approval.\n*   Clinical Director to finalize MOUs with county hospitals by September 30.\n*   Community Partnerships Manager to begin recruitment for bilingual patient navigators by October 1.\n\n### Risks & Limitations\n\nKey assumptions include the timely completion of mobile unit retrofits and successful recruitment of specialized staff. Data limitations include a claims data lag of approximately six months and a client survey administered primarily in English and Lakota (with less than 10% Spanish responses), which may not fully capture the experiences of all linguistic groups. Weather-related cancellations, particularly in January and February (e.g., Q1 FY2025 prenatal contacts were 1,082 vs. 1,236 in Q4 FY2024), skew visit rates, necessitating robust contingency planning.\n\n### Resource Implications\n\nImplementing Option B requires a capital investment of $180,000 and $40,000 in initial operating funds, which can be partially covered by restricted maternal health funds with Board approval for vehicle-related expenses. While our current 12-FTE team can absorb new responsibilities efficiently, the proposed new hires (part-time patient navigators) would be additive. There is a tradeoff with existing unrestricted funds ($60,000 available), which would be largely allocated to this initiative, reducing flexibility for other emergent needs.\n\n### Data Sources & Methods\n\nThis analysis synthesizes data from Electronic Health Records (FY2022\u2013Q1 FY2025), state Department of Health vital records, client surveys (n=284, 52% response rate), GIS travel distance modeling, and a comprehensive cost model, including 5-year straight-line depreciation for mobile units.\n\n**Prepared by:** Tasha Nguyen, DrPH, Evaluation Lead, June 3, 2025, tnguyen@hp-maternal.org | 406-555-0193.

      "content": "# Executive Summary\n**Mobile Prenatal Care Options Analysis and FY2025 Capital Request**\n\n---\n\n## 1) Executive Headline\n\nBoard approval of Option B by August 15, 2025 will deploy two mobile prenatal units to serve 11 rural counties, expanding services within 30 miles of 28% more pregnant clients and generating an estimated 1,040 additional prenatal contacts in 12 months. This requires $180,000 in capital financing (vehicle retrofit and medical equipment) plus $40,000 in operating funds for the first six months. Without this investment, average client travel distances will remain at 47 miles and third-trimester no-show rates will plateau, sustaining preventable preterm birth disparities among Tribal and frontier populations.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Purpose & Context\n\nThis analysis evaluates three deployment models to reduce travel burdens exceeding 60 miles for pregnant mothers across Eastern Montana and Western South Dakota (11 counties; Northern Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux Tribal nations). Mobile prenatal care paired with community health worker (CHW) navigation aims to increase first-trimester entry and continuity of care among low-income and Tribal clients.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Key Findings\n\n- **Visit completion improved sharply**: Prenatal visit completion reached 72% in FY2024, an 18-percentage-point gain versus FY2022 (n=612 pregnancies), with the largest increase among clients entering care in the first trimester (+24 points).\n\n- **Preterm birth declined among engaged clients**: Preterm birth dropped from 11.8% to 9.4% among clients with documented prenatal care (n=344 births, calendar year 2023 through Q1 2025); clients with eight or more contacts achieved a 6.8% preterm birth rate.\n\n- **Equity gains among Tribal clients, but distance barriers persist**: Third-trimester no-show rates among Tribal clients (n=208) fell from 23% to 14%. However, average one-way travel distance remains 47 miles (versus 61-mile baseline), underscoring continued geographic barriers.\n\n- **Option B delivers lowest cost per contact and fastest deployment**: Estimated cost per incremental prenatal contact is $86 under Option B, compared to $142 (status quo) and $128 (satellite clinic). Break-even occurs at 390 additional contacts; deployment can begin within 90 days of approval.\n\n- **Coverage expands substantially under Option B**: Two mobile units support 10\u201312 clinic days per week across all 11 counties, bringing services within 30 miles of 28% more clients (including Harding and Rosebud counties; see Figure 3 map in full report).\n\n**Data Spotlight**: Prenatal contacts totaled 1,118 in Q2 FY2024, 1,204 in Q3, and 1,236 in Q4, with a weather-related dip to 1,082 in Q1 FY2025. Option B projects 1,040 additional contacts in 12 months, representing a 21% increase over the status quo.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Recommendations\n\n**Priority 1 \u2014 Approve Option B and allocate $180,000 capital plus $40,000 operating funds.**  \nOwner: Chief Operating Officer.  \nTimeline: 0\u20133 months (vehicle procurement, retrofit, equipment installation, driver training).  \nResources: Two converted cargo vans ($92,000 each); medical equipment kits ($28,000 combined); insurance, licensing, and driver onboarding ($20,000); operating funds cover fuel, maintenance, and driver wages through January 2026.  \nThis investment positions High Plains Maternal Health Alliance (HPMHA) to serve clients in Harding, Rosebud, and six other underserved counties by November 2025, reducing travel burdens and sustaining preterm birth reductions.\n\n**Execute memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with county hospitals for shared laboratory draws and tele-maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) consultations.**  \nOwner: Clinical Director.  \nTimeline: 0\u20133 months.  \nResources: Legal review (10 staff hours); no direct cost.  \nMOUs enable same-day lab processing and specialist backup, reducing referral delays and duplicate travel for ultrasound and glucose tolerance tests.\n\n**Hire two part-time bilingual patient navigators (Lakota/English and Spanish/English).**  \nOwner: Community Partnerships Manager.  \nTimeline: 3\u20136 months.  \nResources: $48,000 per year combined (0.5 full-time equivalent [FTE] each).  \nNavigators will coordinate scheduling, provide appointment reminders, and support postpartum transition, addressing language barriers noted in client surveys and boosting continuity among Latinx and Tribal clients.\n\n**Establish weather contingency scheduling protocols and short message service (SMS) text-message reminders.**  \nOwner: Operations Manager.  \nTimeline: 0\u20133 months.  \nResources: SMS platform subscription ($3,500 annually).  \nWeather-related cancellations accounted for 14% of no-shows in Q1 FY2025. Automated rescheduling and text alerts are estimated to reduce weather-driven no-shows by 20%, preserving 52 contacts per quarter.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Next Steps & Decision Asks\n\n- **Board Program & Finance Committees vote on Option B, capital allocation, and six-month operating funds by August 15, 2025.**\n- Chief Operating Officer secures vendor contracts and initiates vehicle procurement by August 22, 2025.\n- Clinical Director finalizes county hospital MOUs and submits credentialing applications by September 30, 2025.\n- Community Partnerships Manager posts patient navigator positions by September 1, 2025, with onboarding complete by November 15, 2025.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Risks & Limitations\n\n**Data limitations**: Claims data lag approximately six months; client surveys were administered only in English and Lakota (Spanish responses fewer than 10%), potentially undercounting Latinx needs. Weather-related cancellations skew January\u2013February visit rates, making winter projections conservative.\n\n**Operational risks**: Severe winter road closures may reduce mobile unit access in Harding and Carter counties by 8\u201312 days per year. Mitigation includes contingency scheduling, local host-site partnerships for overnight parking, and priority snow-route planning with county road crews.\n\n**Financial assumptions**: Break-even at 390 additional contacts assumes stable reimbursement under Medicaid managed care; rural health clinic billing status application is pending (decision expected October 2025). Delayed approval may reduce net revenue by $18,000 in Year 1.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Resource Implications\n\nTotal 12-month cost for Option B is $224,000 ($180,000 capital; $44,000 net operating after Medicaid reimbursement). Capital financing will draw $150,000 from restricted maternal health funds (Board approval required to reallocate for vehicles and equipment) and $30,000 from unrestricted reserves. Operating funds require $40,000 in new revenue or bridge financing through January 2026, after which visit volume supports cost recovery. Staffing draws from current nurse-midwives (three FTE) plus two 0.5-FTE drivers/emergency medical technicians (EMTs), avoiding new clinical hires in Year 1.\n\n---\n\n## 8) Data Sources & Methods\n\nElectronic health record (EHR) extracts (FY2022\u2013Q1 FY2025; n=1,804 pregnancies), state vital records (Department of Health birth certificates), client surveys (n=284; 52% response rate), and geographic information system (GIS) travel-distance modeling. Cost model includes five-year straight-line depreciation for mobile units, Medicaid and private-insurance fee schedules, and historical fuel and maintenance costs from similar HPMHA fleet vehicles.\n\n---\n\n## 9) Contact & Next Reading\n\nPrepared by Tasha Nguyen, DrPH, Evaluation Lead, June 3, 2025, tnguyen@hp-maternal.org | 406-555-0193.  \nFor detailed option comparison, financial assumptions, and county-by-county coverage maps, see Section 3, pages 14\u201317 of the full report at https://hp-maternal.org/reports/2025-mobile-options.\n\n---\n\n**Word count: 798**",

The scope includes mobile prenatal care and community health worker (CHW) navigation across 11 counties over the next 12 months, with intended outcomes of higher visit adherence, earlier entry to care, and reduced preterm births.\n\n3) Key Findings\n- Access and adherence: Prenatal visit completion rose to 72% in FY2024 (+18 points vs. FY2022; n=612 pregnancies), with the largest gains among first-trimester entrants (+24 points).\n- Birth outcomes: Preterm birth among engaged clients fell from 11.8% to 9.4% (n=344 births, CY2023\u2013Q1 2025), with the lowest rate (6.8%) among clients receiving 8 or more contacts.\n- Equity progress with gaps: Among Tribal clients (n=208), third-trimester no-shows dropped from 23% to 14%, yet average travel remains 47 miles (vs. 61 miles at baseline), underscoring persistent access barriers.\n- Cost-effectiveness and scale: Option B\u2019s cost per incremental prenatal contact is $86 vs. $142 (Option A) and $128 (Option C) over 12 months; break-even occurs at 390 additional contacts, with a projected 1,040 additional contacts under Option B.\n- Operational feasibility: Two units can cover 10\u201312 clinic days/week across 11 counties by using current nurse-midwives and adding 0.5 FTE driver/EMT per unit.\n\nData Spotlight: Under Option B, service coverage within 30 miles of clients increases 28%, adding Harding and Rosebud counties and reaching an estimated 1,040 additional contacts in 12 months (Figure 3, map).\n\n4) Recommendations\n- Priority 1 \u2014 Approve Option B and related financing by August 15. Owner: Chief Operating Officer (COO). Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: $180,000 capital for unit retrofit/equipment; $40,000 for six months of operations; vendor purchase orders; onboarding for two 0.5 FTE driver/EMTs; clinical kits and telehealth setup. Alignment: Fastest deployment, highest reach per dollar.\n- Execute memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with county hospitals for labs and tele\u2013maternal-fetal medicine (tele-MFM) consults. Owner: Clinical Director. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: Legal review (\u224810 hours); no direct cost. Benefit: Same-day labs; faster risk stratification; reduced repeat trips.\n- Hire two part-time bilingual patient navigators (Lakota/English; Spanish/English) to improve scheduling, reminders, and benefits enrollment. Owner: Community Partnerships Manager. Timeline: 3\u20136 months. Resources: \u2248$48,000/year combined. Benefit: Addresses language access; supports Tribal clients and seasonal workers.\n- Implement weather contingency scheduling and SMS reminders. Owner: Operations Manager. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: \u2248$3,500 for SMS platform; routing software adjustments. Benefit: Estimated 20% reduction in weather-related no-shows; smoother county site coordination.\n\n5) Next Steps & Decision Asks\n- Board Program & Finance Committees: Vote to approve Option B with $180,000 capital and $40,000 operating funds by August 15.\n- COO: Finalize vendor contracts, unit retrofit specs, and driver/EMT hiring by September 1; launch route pilot by October 15.\n- County health departments and Tribal health partners: Confirm parking sites, lab handoffs, and weekly schedules by August 30.\n- Clinical Director: Execute MOUs for labs and tele-MFM by September 15; staff training completed by October 1.\n\n6) Risks & Limitations\n- Data constraints: Claims data lag \u22486 months; client survey offered in English and Lakota only (Spanish responses <10%); weather-related cancellations depress Jan\u2013Feb visit rates. Mitigation: Combine electronic health record (EHR) and vital records; expand survey languages in FY2025; adjust analyses for seasonal weather.\n- Operational assumptions: Procurement or staffing delays could extend the 90-day deployment window. Mitigation: Secure two vendor quotes and maintain per-diem driver pool. \n- N/A: No other material data gaps reported.\n\n7) Resource Implications\nThe decision authorizes $180,000 in capital and $40,000 for initial operations (six months). Board approval enables use of restricted maternal health funds for vehicles per policy and complements $60,000 in unrestricted funds. Tradeoffs include deferring a fixed-site satellite clinic (Option C) and focusing staff schedules on mobile delivery.\n\n8) Data Sources & Methods\nFindings draw on EHR extracts (FY2022\u2013Q1 FY2025), state Department of Health vital records, client surveys (n=284; 52% response), geographic information system (GIS) travel modeling, and a cost model with five-year straight-line depreciation for mobile units.\n\n9) Contact & Next Reading\nPrepared by Tasha Nguyen, DrPH, Evaluation Lead, June 3, 2025, tnguyen@hp-maternal.org | 406-555-0193.

We request the Board approve a $1,100,000 Year 1 investment and authorize a $600,000 reallocation to scale this proven model, alongside authorizing fundraising for a $500,000 matching grant by March 31, 2026.\n\n### Purpose & Context\n\nThis report details the successful pilot of GLLP\u2019s blended digital learning model, which enhances adult and family literacy, GED attainment, and digital skill acquisition among low-wage workers across Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. The pilot integrated virtual classes, device lending, and in-person coaching to improve education and employment outcomes while expanding access and reducing waitlists.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n*   **Expanded Access and Reduced Waitlists:** The pilot enrolled 3,280 learners across three cities in FY2025 (a 38% increase over FY2023), successfully reducing program waitlists by 41% (from 1,120 to 660 individuals).\n*   **Improved Learner Outcomes:** Digital learners achieved a 72% GED pass rate (n=614 testers), outperforming the 63% rate of comparison cohorts (n=402). English as a Second Language (ESL) learners saw an average 9-point increase in CASAS scores, with 68% achieving level gains (n=1,940).\n*   **Enhanced Equity and Device Access:** Significant outcome gains were observed among specific demographic groups, including a 13-point increase in GED pass rates for Black learners (n=318) and an 11-point increase in ESL gains for Latino learners (n=812). Device access among served households increased from 54% to 91%.\n*   **Cost Efficiency and Retention:** The cost per active learner in the pilot was $612, a 27% reduction compared to the traditional model's $840. The pilot also achieved higher learner retention at 6 months (74%) versus the traditional model (66%).\n*   **Positive Employment Trajectories:** Among learners reporting employment data (n=1,998), 46% secured employment within six months. The median self-reported hourly wage for these learners increased by $2.30, from $13.80 to $16.10, demonstrating tangible economic benefits.\n\n**Data Spotlight:** Figure 5 in the full report highlights the reliability of device lending, showing that 1,860 devices were lent with a robust 96% hotspot uptime, crucial for continuous digital engagement.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n**Priority 1.** **Authorize $1,100,000 for Year 1 scale-up and reallocate $600,000 from under-enrolled in-school tutoring programs.** This reallocation will support the shift of 6 full-time staff, the purchase of 900 new devices, and the expansion of the existing hotspot pool by 300 units.\n*   *Owner:* Chief Program Officer\n*   *Timeline:* 0\u20133 months\n*   *Resources:* $600,000 internal reallocation, $500,000 external fundraising required.\n\n2.  **Hire 5 additional digital navigators, deploying one per major neighborhood hub.** These navigators will provide critical on-site technical support and digital literacy coaching to learners.\n    *   *Owner:* Regional Directors\n    *   *Timeline:* 0\u20133 months\n    *   *Cost:* Approximately $350,000 annually.\n\n3.  **Integrate the Learning Management System (LMS) with the case management system to create a unified data tracking platform.** This will streamline data collection, improve reporting efficiency, and enhance individualized learner support.\n    *   *Owner:* Director of Evaluation\n    *   *Timeline:* 3\u20136 months\n    *   *Cost:* Approximately $120,000 for vendor services and IT integration.\n\n4.  **Formalize Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with local libraries and workforce centers to establish co-located evening lab access.** This expands physical access points for digital learners and leverages community resources.\n    *   *Owner:* Partnerships Director\n    *   *Timeline:* 0\u20136 months\n    *   *Cost:* Minimal, primarily in-kind space and administrative coordination.\n\n5.  **Commission an independent evaluation of the scaled digital learning program, including a pre-registered analysis plan.** This will ensure robust, external validation of program effectiveness and support future funding efforts.\n    *   *Owner:* Director of Evaluation\n    *   *Timeline:* 6\u201312 months\n    *   *Cost:* Approximately $85,000.\n\n### Next Steps & Decision Asks\n\n*   **Board to vote on proposed investment and reallocation by June 30, 2025.**\n*   Chief Program Officer to initiate staff transitions and device procurement by July 15, 2025.\n*   VP Finance (with the Development Director) to lead fundraising for $500,000 match by March 31, 2026.\n*   Regional Directors to begin recruitment for digital navigators by July 30, 2025.\n\n### Risks & Limitations\n\nThe pilot's quasi-experimental design lacked randomization, potentially introducing unmeasured confounding variables. An 18% attrition rate over 12 months for digital learners could influence long-term outcome measurements. Wage data was self-reported by 61% of learners, which may introduce reporting bias. Lastly, device connectivity quality varies by neighborhood, posing potential barriers for some learners. Mitigation strategies include implementing an independent evaluation with a pre-registered analysis plan and targeted support for learners in areas with inconsistent connectivity.\n\n### Resource Implications\n\nThe proposed Year 1 investment of $1,100,000 will be supported by a $600,000 internal reallocation from under-enrolled in-school tutoring, requiring a corresponding $500,000 in new restricted fundraising. This strategic shift leverages existing operational capacity from our 45 FTE and 120 volunteer tutors, maximizing impact within a $12.4M organizational budget without requiring significant new core operational funding.\n\n### Data Sources & Methods\n\nData was gathered from GLLP administrative records from FY2023\u2013FY2025, utilizing matched comparison cohorts by city, age, and baseline academic levels for intent-to-treat analyses. A learner survey (n=2,104, 64% response rate) and 6-month wage follow-up (n=1,998) provided additional qualitative and quantitative insights.\n\n### Contact & Next Reading\n\nPrepared by Jamal Carter, Director of Evaluation and Learning, May 28, 2025, jcarter@gllp.org | 216-555-0177.

Great Lakes Literacy Partners (GLLP) piloted blended adult education (General Educational Development (GED), English as a Second Language (ESL)) with device lending and digital navigation from July 2023\u2013May 2025 to improve completion, equity, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n## 3) Key Findings\n\n- **Scale & access:** Enrollment grew to 3,280 learners (+38% vs. FY2023 baseline of 2,377; n=3,280), reducing combined waitlists from 1,120 to 660 (\u221241%).\n\n- **Learning outcomes:** GED pass rate reached 72% among pilot learners (n=614 testers) versus 63% in matched comparison classrooms (n=402); ESL level gains (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS) scale) achieved by 68% of learners (n=1,940), +9 points vs. baseline.\n\n- **Equity gains:** Black learners improved GED pass rates by 13 percentage points (n=318); Latino learners posted +11-point ESL gains (n=812). Device access among households served rose from 54% to 91% (n=1,860 devices lent).\n\n- **Cost & retention:** Cost per active learner fell to $612 (pilot) from $840 (traditional model); 6-month retention improved to 74% (pilot) vs. 66% (comparison).\n\n- **Employment & wages:** Among learners providing employment data (n=1,998; 61% of enrolled), 46% secured jobs within 6 months; median self-reported hourly wage rose from $13.80 to $16.10 (+$2.30; +17%).\n\n**Data Spotlight:** Figure 4 shows digital learners sustained a 12-percentage-point retention advantage over classroom-only peers between weeks 8\u201320; Figure 5 documents 96% uptime for 1,240 hotspots across all three cities.\n\n## 4) Recommendations\n\n**Priority 1 \u2014 Approve $1.1M Year 1 investment and authorize $600,000 internal reallocation.**  \nShift resources from under-enrolled in-school tutoring (current utilization 42%) to scale digital learning infrastructure: purchase 900 additional devices, expand hotspot pool by 300 units, and reallocate 6 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions to digital instruction and tech support. **Owner:** Chief Program Officer. **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months. **Resources:** $600,000 reallocation plus $600,000 new restricted revenue; capital purchase $189,000 (devices), connectivity subscriptions $88,200/year.\n\n**Add 5 digital navigators (1 per major neighborhood hub).**  \nDedicated staff to troubleshoot devices, coach learners on digital literacy, and coordinate evening lab schedules in Cleveland (2), Detroit (2), Milwaukee (1). **Owner:** Regional Directors (Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee). **Timeline:** 0\u20133 months. **Cost:** $350,000/year (salary + benefits for 5 FTE at $70,000 loaded cost each).\n\n**Integrate learning management system (LMS) and case management for unified learner data.**  \nCurrent systems operate in silos; integration will enable real-time attendance, progress tracking, and outcomes reporting across platforms. **Owner:** Director of Evaluation. **Timeline:** 3\u20136 months. **Cost:** $120,000 (vendor customization $85,000; internal Information Technology (IT) implementation 0.5 FTE for 6 months).\n\n**Formalize memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with public libraries and workforce centers for co-located evening labs.**  \nSecure in-kind space commitments in 12 neighborhoods with low home broadband penetration. **Owner:** Partnerships Director. **Timeline:** 0\u20136 months. **Resources:** Staff time only; facilities provided in-kind by partners.\n\n**Commission independent evaluation with pre-registered analysis plan.**  \nExternal evaluator to validate outcomes, test cost model assumptions, and support National Literacy Fund reporting requirements. **Owner:** Director of Evaluation. **Timeline:** 6\u201312 months. **Cost:** $85,000 (consultant contract).\n\n## 5) Next Steps & Decision Asks\n\n- **Board votes on $1.1M Year 1 investment and $600,000 reallocation by June 30, 2025.**\n- Chief Program Officer presents detailed spending plan and milestones to Finance Committee by July 15, 2025.\n- Development Director launches $500,000 fundraising campaign for National Literacy Fund match by July 1, 2025; deadline March 31, 2026.\n- Regional Directors hire 5 digital navigators and execute library/workforce center MOUs by September 30, 2025.\n\n## 6) Risks & Limitations\n\n**Data limitations:** Quasi-experimental design (no randomization); comparison cohorts matched on city, age, and baseline level but not all confounders. Attrition over 12 months was 18%; wage data self-reported for 61% of learners (n=1,998), introducing potential recall and social-desirability bias. Device connectivity quality varies by neighborhood; 4% of hotspots experienced >10% downtime.\n\n**Operational risks:** Reallocation from in-school tutoring may affect 180 youth currently enrolled (mitigation: phase tutoring contracts through August 2025; refer students to school-district partners). Device theft/damage averaged 3.2% (mitigation: $32,000 replacement reserve budgeted). National Literacy Fund match contingent on Board vote and first-year milestones; failure to raise $500,000 by March 31, 2026, forfeits challenge grant.\n\n**Mitigation:** Independent evaluation (Recommendation 5) will validate outcomes and refine cost model; phased reallocation minimizes disruption; device insurance and learner agreements reduce loss exposure.\n\n## 7) Resource Implications\n\nYear 1 investment totals $1,100,000: $600,000 internal reallocation from under-enrolled tutoring (6 FTE shifted; affects 180 current youth participants, transitioned to district partners by August 2025) plus $500,000 new restricted fundraising (National Literacy Fund challenge match deadline March 31, 2026). Capital outlay includes $189,000 for 900 Chromebooks and $88,200/year connectivity.

      "content": "1) Executive Headline\nBoard approval of a $1,100,000 Year 1 investment, plus authorization to reallocate $600,000 from under-enrolled in-school tutoring, will allow Great Lakes Literacy Partners (GLLP) to scale a proven digital learning model across Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. This will cut waitlists, raise General Educational Development (GED) and English as a Second Language (ESL) outcomes, and lower cost per learner. The action also authorizes fundraising to secure a $500,000 match from National Literacy Fund by March 31, 2026.\n\n2) Purpose & Context\nAdult and family literacy, GED attainment, and digital skills are gating factors for low-wage workers in our three cities. From FY2024\u2013FY2025, GLLP piloted blended instruction (online classes, in-person coaching) with device and hotspot lending to expand access and improve outcomes; the FY2026 plan scales what worked.\n\n3) Key Findings\n- Scale and access: 3,280 learners enrolled in pilot cities (+38% vs. FY2023; n=3,280), reducing waitlists by 41% (from 1,120 to 660).\n- Learning outcomes: GED pass rate 72% in the pilot (n=614 testers) vs. 63% in matched comparison (n=402). ESL gains on Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS): 68% achieved level gains (n=1,940), 9 percentage points above baseline.\n- Equity: Largest improvements among Black learners (+13 points GED pass rate, n=318) and Latino learners (+11 points ESL gains, n=812). Household device access rose from 54% to 91%.\n- Cost and persistence: Cost per active learner $612 (pilot) vs. $840 (traditional). Six-month retention 74% (pilot) vs. 66% (comparison).\n- Employment and wages: Among learners with employment follow-up (n=1,998), 46% obtained a job within six months; median hourly wage rose from $13.80 to $16.10 (+$2.30).\n\nData Spotlight: Figures 4\u20135 show a 12-point retention advantage for digital learners between weeks 8\u201320 and document 1,860 devices and 1,240 hotspots lent, with 96% average hotspot uptime.\n\n4) Recommendations\n- Priority 1 \u2014 Approve scale-up and internal shift. Action: Approve $1,100,000 Year 1, reallocate $600,000 from under-enrolled in-school tutoring to digital. Owner: Chief Program Officer. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Resources: shift 6 FTE; procure 900 Chromebooks and 300 hotspots; align schedules for evening virtual classes and in-person coaching in all three cities.\n- Add digital navigators. Action: Hire 5 digital navigators (one per major neighborhood hub) to support onboarding, device lending, and tech troubleshooting. Owner: Regional Directors. Timeline: 0\u20133 months. Estimated cost: $350,000/year including benefits.\n- Integrate data systems. Action: Connect the learning management system (LMS) and case management platform for unified analytics and early-warning outreach. Owner: Director of Evaluation. Timeline: 3\u20136 months. Estimated cost: $120,000 (vendor and IT support).\n- Secure community access points. Action: Execute memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with libraries and workforce centers for co-located evening labs and Wi-Fi. Owner: Partnerships Director. Timeline: 0\u20136 months. Cost: minimal; primarily in-kind space.\n- Independent evaluation. Action: Commission a pre-registered evaluation to validate outcomes and inform city and donor reporting. Owner: Director of Evaluation. Timeline: 6\u201312 months. Estimated cost: $85,000.\n\n5) Next Steps & Decision Asks\n- Board of Directors: Vote to approve the $1,100,000 Year 1 investment, authorize the $600,000 reallocation, and authorize fundraising for a $500,000 match by March 31, 2026 (by June 30, 2025).\n- Chief Program Officer: Launch procurement of 900 devices and 300 hotspots within 30 days of approval; reassign 6 FTE by August 1, 2025.\n- VP of Development: Execute National Literacy Fund challenge grant agreement within 15 days of approval; initiate corporate technology donor campaign by July 15, 2025.\n- Director of Evaluation: Issue RFP and select independent evaluator by August 31, 2025.\n\n6) Risks & Limitations\n- Design: Quasi-experimental matched comparison (no random assignment); results may reflect unmeasured differences. Mitigation: Pre-registered evaluation in FY2026 and sensitivity checks.\n- Data completeness: Employment and wage outcomes are self-reported for 1,998 learners (about 61% of total). Mitigation: Add administrative wage verification where feasible and increase follow-up rates.\n- Technology variability: Connectivity quality varies by neighborhood despite 96% average hotspot uptime. Mitigation: Expand co-located labs and negotiate prioritized coverage with carriers.\n- Attrition: Measured at 6 months (74% retained); longer-term persistence beyond 12 months requires continued monitoring.\n\n7) Resource Implications\nYear 1 requires $1,100,000 plus a $600,000 internal reallocation. Major costs: 5 digital navigators ($350,000), data integration ($120,000), evaluation ($85,000), devices/connectivity and instruction scaling. Tradeoff: reduce under-enrolled in-school tutoring sections to fund digital scale while maintaining core in-person options.\n\n8) Data Sources & Methods\nAdministrative data from FY2023\u2013FY2025, matched comparison by city, age, and baseline level; intent-to-treat analyses. Learner survey (n=2,104; 64% response) and six-month employment/wage follow-up (n=1,998).\n\n9) Contact & Next Reading\nPrepared by Jamal Carter, Director of Evaluation and Learning, May 28, 2025, jcarter@gllp.org | 216-555-0177.
