Learn about their impact and how you can help. (159 characters)\n\n**URL Slug:** `/fresh-blocks-spring-2025-impact`\n\n---\n\n# Growing Futures: Fresh Blocks Apprentices Thrive on Detroit\u2019s East Side\n\nFor 32 Black and Latinx teens from Detroit\u2019s Denby, Southeastern, and Pershing High Schools this spring, an after-school gardening apprenticeship wasn't just about planting seeds \u2013 it was about cultivating leadership, community, and personal growth. These young people, spanning ZIP codes 48205, 48213, and 48214, spent their afternoons learning, leading, and growing over 1,300 pounds of fresh produce for their neighborhoods.\n\n## The Need: Nurturing Growth in Our Community\n\nDetroit\u2019s East Side is a vibrant community, yet many areas face limited grocery access, making fresh, nutritious food a challenge for residents. Beyond food access, opportunities for paid, skills-based learning for high school students are vital for their development and future economic mobility. Eastside Foodways Collective believes in empowering our youth to be agents of change within their own neighborhoods, fostering a healthier, more resilient food system from the ground up.\n\n## Our Approach: Hands-On Learning, Real-World Impact\n\nThe Fresh Blocks Youth Garden Apprenticeship is a paid, after-school program designed to empower young people ages 14\u201318. Apprentices commit 8\u201310 hours per week across three micro-farms, rotating through leadership roles, participating in weekly nutrition labs, and operating Saturday pop-up *farm stands*. This holistic approach combines practical agricultural skills with essential life skills, preparing them for future success while directly benefiting their community. We provide stipends and address transportation barriers to ensure access for all eligible youth.\n\n## Results in Numbers: A Spring of Significant Growth\n\nThe Spring 2025 Fresh Blocks cohort demonstrated remarkable progress, exceeding many of our program goals:\n\n*   **Strong Commitment and Retention:**\n    *   **36 youth enrolled, with 32 completing the program (89% completion rate).** This significantly surpassed our 2024 baseline of 74% and exceeded our 2025 goal of 80% retention. Four apprentices withdrew due to family moves or new work commitments.\n    *   **Average attendance for the 10-week program was 91%,** a testament to the apprentices' dedication.\n    *   To ensure active participation, **240 DDOT 24-hour bus passes were distributed,** successfully removing transportation as a barrier.\n*   **Empowering Through Financial Support:**\n    *   **$9,600 in stipends were disbursed** via prepaid cards, with each apprentice receiving $300. We maintained a 100% on-time payment record, providing reliable income for our youth.\n*   **Harvesting Abundance for the Community:**\n    *   Apprentices harvested an impressive **1,386 pounds of fresh produce** (including kale, collards, and tomatoes), exceeding our 2025 goal of 1,200 pounds and ensuring a plentiful supply for the community.\n    *   **64% of this produce was distributed free of charge** at our neighborhood *farm stands*, while **36% was sold to four local corner stores**, generating **$1,420 in revenue** which was reinvested directly into soil amendments and essential tools for our farms.\n*   **Cultivating Health and Confidence:**\n    *   Apprentices reported a notable increase in their daily fruit and vegetable intake, rising from an average of **1.1 servings to 2.3 servings (+1.2 servings).** This surpassed our 2025 goal of +1 serving and improved upon the 2024 baseline of 1.2 servings.\n    *   Self-efficacy, a key measure of confidence in one's ability to succeed, increased from a 3.0 to a **3.9 on a 5-point scale.**\n    *   **12 youth earned their ServSafe Food Handler certification**, a valuable professional credential.\n    *   **8 apprentices secured paid summer jobs with Greening of Detroit**, showcasing the program's success in preparing them for ongoing employment opportunities.\n*   **Prioritizing Safety and Equity:**\n    *   **0 safety incidents** were reported throughout the program. A proactive heat plan was enacted on five high-index days, shifting to earlier morning shifts and implementing frequent hydration breaks.\n    *   Our commitment to equity was evident in the cohort's demographics: **88% Black, 9% Latinx, and 3% Arab American.**\n    *   **92% of apprentices were eligible for free/reduced-price lunch,** exceeding our equity goal of at least 85% and underscoring our focus on serving youth from low-income households. **21% were English learners**, reflecting the diverse linguistic landscape of our communities.\n\n### **Chart 1: Fresh Blocks Apprenticeship Youth Served (Spring 2025)**\n\n*(Simple bar chart showing demographic breakdown: 88% Black, 9% Latinx, 3% Arab American. Accessible Alt Text: A bar chart titled \"Fresh Blocks Apprenticeship Youth Served (Spring 2025)\" showing that 88% of participants were Black, 9% Latinx, and 3% Arab American.)*\n\n### **Image 1: Before & After Garden Transformation**\n\n*(Two side-by-side photos. \"Before\" shows an underutilized plot of land; \"After\" shows the same plot transformed into a vibrant micro-farm with apprentices tending to plants. Accessible Alt Text: Two images side-by-side. The first, labeled \"Before,\" shows an empty, grassy urban lot. The second, labeled \"After,\" shows the same lot transformed into a thriving urban garden with rows of mature plants and two teenagers harvesting vegetables.)*\n\n## Voices from the Program: Cultivating Beyond the Garden\n\n\"Before Fresh Blocks, I didn't think much about eating vegetables,\" shared Ana, a 16-year-old apprentice from Pershing High School. \"Now, I know how to grow them, and I've even cooked some of the collards here for my family. It feels good to bring healthy food home.\" Ana\u2019s story highlights how the program sparks a deeper connection to food and community.\n\n*(Written consent obtained from participant and guardian via bilingual (English/Spanish) form on file; pseudonyms used; photo consent limited to group shots; no last names or school schedules published.)*\n\nThe introduction of our peer mentorship model this past season significantly contributed to improved retention and a stronger sense of shared responsibility among apprentices. This fostered an environment where younger participants felt supported and older apprentices developed valuable leadership skills.\n\n## What\u2019s Next & How You Can Help\n\nThe success of our Spring 2025 cohort fills us with immense pride and sets a strong foundation for future programs. Apprentices have requested more dedicated cooking time in their nutrition labs and additional financial literacy workshops, which we plan to integrate into the fall curriculum.\n\nWe are committed to expanding the Fresh Blocks program, reaching more Detroit youth, and increasing our positive impact. You can directly support these young leaders and their community efforts:\n\n*   **Donate:** Your contribution helps fund vital youth stipends, ensuring equitable access and compensation for their hard work, and provides necessary bus passes to eliminate transportation barriers.

      "content": "# From Seed to Paycheck: How 32 Detroit Teens Harvested Nearly 1,400 Pounds of Fresh Food\u2014and a Future in Urban Ag\n\n**By Marisol Ortega, Program Manager**  \nPublished July 8, 2025\n\nWhen 15-year-old \"Amara\" stepped onto the quarter-acre plot at Fresh Blocks' Mack Avenue micro-farm in April, she'd never tasted collard greens fresh from the soil\u2014or imagined she could grow food, lead a team, and earn a steady paycheck before her 16th birthday. Three months later, she and 31 other Detroit teens from Denby, Southeastern, and Pershing High Schools did all three, harvesting 1,386 pounds of produce, distributing free vegetables to 412 East Side neighbors, and banking $9,600 in earned stipends.\n\n---\n\n## The Need\n\nAcross ZIP codes 48205, 48213, and 48214, too many young people grow up in neighborhoods with limited grocery access\u2014where corner stores outnumber supermarkets and fresh kale is harder to find than chips. At the same time, Black and Latinx teens face some of the steepest barriers to paid work experience: only 23% of Detroit youth ages 16\u201319 held jobs in 2024, compared to 35% statewide.\n\nBut what if the solution to both challenges\u2014access to nutritious food *and* pathways to employment\u2014could be grown right in the neighborhood?\n\n---\n\n## Our Approach\n\nThe Fresh Blocks Youth Garden Apprenticeship is a paid, after-school program that plants teens in real jobs at three East Side micro-farms. From April through June 2025, 36 apprentices worked 8\u201310 hours per week:\n\n- **Learning by doing:** Planting, weeding, harvesting kale, collards, and tomatoes; rotating through leadership roles (team lead, harvest coordinator, community outreach).\n- **Building skills beyond the garden:** Weekly nutrition labs (knife skills, recipe testing) and Saturday pop-up farm stands where youth weighed produce, handled transactions, and distributed bilingual recipe cards in English and Spanish.\n- **Earning while they learn:** $300 stipend per apprentice, paid on time via prepaid card every two weeks\u2014no waiting, no barriers.\n- **Removing obstacles:** 240 Detroit Department of Transportation 24-hour bus passes distributed to ensure every teen could get to the farm safely and reliably.\n\n---\n\n## Results in Numbers\n\n**More teens stuck with it\u2014and thrived.**  \nThirty-two of 36 apprentices completed the full 10-week program (89% retention), up sharply from our 2024 baseline of 74% and exceeding our 2025 goal of 80%. Four withdrew due to family moves or conflicting work schedules\u2014life happens. Average attendance hit 91% across all sessions.\n\n*Why it worked:* After introducing a peer mentor model this spring\u2014pairing returning apprentices with newcomers\u2014teens told us they felt more connected and confident tackling new tasks.\n\n**They grew food\u2014and healthier habits.**  \nYouth harvested **1,386 pounds** of kale, collards, and tomatoes (beating our 1,200-pound goal). Sixty-four percent was distributed free at pop-up stands; 36% sold to four corner stores, generating $1,420 reinvested in compost and hand tools.\n\nOn their plates, change showed up fast: daily fruit and vegetable servings jumped from 1.1 at program start to 2.3 by June\u2014a gain of **1.2 servings**, surpassing our +1.0 goal and improving on the 2024 baseline of 1.2 servings.\n\n**Credentials and careers took root.**  \n- **12 youth** earned ServSafe Food Handler certification\u2014a credential recognized by restaurants and food businesses citywide.\n- **8 apprentices** secured paid summer positions with [Greening of Detroit](https://www.greeningofdetroit.com/), turning a spring apprenticeship into year-round opportunity.\n- Self-efficacy scores (measuring confidence in problem-solving and teamwork on a 5-point scale) rose from 3.0 to 3.9.\n\n**Safety first, always.**  \nZero incidents over 10 weeks. On five high-heat-index days, we activated our heat safety plan: earlier morning shifts, mandatory hydration breaks, and shaded rest areas.\n\n**Equity in action.**  \nOur cohort reflected the East Side: 88% Black, 9% Latinx, 3% Arab American. Ninety-two percent of participants qualified for free or reduced-price lunch (above our 85% equity goal), and 21% were English learners. Every element\u2014bilingual materials, transit passes, on-time stipends\u2014was designed to meet teens where they are.\n\n---\n\n## Voices from the Program\n\n**Meet \"Amara\"** (pseudonym), a sophomore from Denby High School who joined in April with zero gardening experience.\n\n\"At first I thought I'd just be pulling weeds for money,\" she laughs. \"But I learned how to run the Saturday stand, talk to people about why local food matters, and cook collard greens three different ways. The best part? My little brother actually *asked* for the kale chips I made in nutrition lab. That never happens.\"\n\nBy June, Amara had been promoted to harvest coordinator, leading a team of four peers in daily pick schedules and quality checks. She starts a paid role with Greening of Detroit this month.\n\n*(Written consent obtained from participant and guardian via bilingual English/Spanish form on file; pseudonyms used; photo consent limited to group shots; no last names or school schedules published.)*\n\n---\n\n## What's Next\n\nApprentices told us loud and clear: they want *more* cooking time and financial literacy workshops woven into the next cohort. We're listening. This fall, we'll pilot \"Seed to Savings\" sessions covering budgeting, banking, and recipe costing.\n\nAnd we're scaling up: our goal for the Summer 2025 cohort is 45 apprentices across four micro-farm sites.\n\n---\n\n## How You Can Help\n\n**Fund the future.**  \nIt costs $300 to sponsor one teen for a full season\u2014covering their stipend, bus passes, safety gear, and certifications.

Across Denby, Southeastern, and Pershing High Schools, Black and Latinx teens ages 14\u201318 built skills, earned paychecks, and brought greens home to their blocks.\n\nH2: The Need\nDetroit\u2019s East Side neighborhoods include many areas with limited grocery access and few paid after-school opportunities. Teens tell us they want real-world work experience, safe spaces to lead, and practical skills they can use at home.\n\n- Transportation is a hurdle for many students; reliable bus access can determine whether youth make it to programs after school.\n- Fruit and vegetable intake among U.S. high schoolers remains low, which affects long-term health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports most teens do not meet daily produce recommendations. \n- Our approach centers youth leadership, stipends, and neighborhood-based growing so learning and impact stay local.\n\nExternal sources:\n- CDC on teen fruit and vegetable intake: https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition\n- USDA Food Access Research Atlas (for context on limited grocery access): https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/\n\nH2: Our Approach\nFresh Blocks is a paid, after-school garden apprenticeship (8\u201310 hours/week) with placements at three East Side micro-farms. Youth rotate through leadership roles, run Saturday pop-up farm stands, and join weekly nutrition labs.\n\nWhat we provide\n- Stipends: $300 per apprentice via prepaid cards (on time, every time)\n- Transit: DDOT 24-hour bus passes to reduce barriers\n- Skill-building: soil health, planting, harvest, ServSafe Food Handler prep, and customer service\n- Safety: heat index plan with earlier shifts and hydration breaks\n\nWhat\u2019s new this spring\n- Peer mentor model: Returning youth coached first-time apprentices, strengthening belonging and retention.\n- Corner store partnership: Teens sold produce to four nearby stores, then tracked revenue for soil and tool upgrades.\n\nH2: Results in Numbers\nEnrollment and completion\n- 36 enrolled; 32 completed. That\u2019s 89% completion\u2014up from the 2024 baseline of 74% and above our 2025 goal of 80%.\n- Four youth withdrew due to family moves or work schedule changes.\n- Why it matters: The peer mentor model and transit supports kept teens engaged through finals and spring sports.\n\nAttendance and access\n- Average attendance: 91% across 10 weeks.\n- 240 DDOT 24-hour bus passes distributed to remove transit barriers.\n- Equity check: 92% of apprentices were from free/reduced-price lunch households (goal: at least 85% met). Cohort demographics: 88% Black, 9% youth who identify as Latinx, 3% Arab American; 21% English learners.\n\nStipends\n- $300 per apprentice; $9,600 disbursed via prepaid cards; 100% on-time payments.\n- Why it matters: Paid roles help teens contribute at home and treat apprenticeship as real work.\n\nFood grown and shared\n- 1,386 lbs harvested (kale, collards, tomatoes), exceeding our 2025 goal of 1,200 lbs.\n- Distribution: 64% shared free at three neighborhood pop-up stands; 36% sold to four corner stores.\n- Revenue: $1,420 reinvested in soil and tools\u2014youth tracked every dollar.\n\nHealthy habits and confidence\n- Fruit/veg intake rose from 1.1 to 2.3 servings/day (+1.2). We aimed for +1; youth surpassed it. Baseline in 2024 was 1.2 servings/day.\n- Self-efficacy (5-point scale) climbed from 3.0 to 3.9\u2014youth reported feeling more capable making decisions and solving problems.\n- Certifications and jobs: 12 earned ServSafe Food Handler; 8 placed in paid summer jobs with Greening of Detroit.\n\nSafety\n- Zero safety incidents. The heat plan was enacted on five high-index days (earlier start times, shade, hydration breaks, and team check-ins).\n\nCommunity reach\n- Three pop-up stands served 412 neighbors. Youth shared 210 bilingual recipe cards (English/Spanish) featuring collards, kale, and salsa fresca.\n\nRecommended visuals\n- Bar chart: \u201cSpring 2025 Goals vs. Actuals\u201d (Retention, Harvest lbs, Fruit/veg increase).

In the 2024\u20132025 school year, Colorado Arts Access\u2019s Mobile Makers Lab brought this future directly to 1,184 students, sparking innovation and boosting confidence.\n\n## The Need: Bridging theSTEAM Divide in Rural Colorado\n\nThe expansive San Luis Valley, encompassing Alamosa, Conejos, Costilla, Mineral, Rio Grande, and Saguache counties, is a region rich in culture but often overlooked when it comes to equitable access to cutting-edge STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) education. Rural schools frequently lack the resources and specialized instructors for hands-on, technology-rich learning experiences. This disparity can limit the horizons of young students, particularly those for whom English is a second language or whose families face economic challenges. Colorado Arts Access is dedicated to closing this gap, ensuring that every child, regardless of their zip code, has the chance to explore, create, and thrive.\n\n## Our Approach: Bringing Innovation to Their Doorstep\n\nOur Mobile Makers Lab program deploys two specially outfitted vans directly to schools, transforming gymnasiums and classrooms into vibrant innovation hubs. Each van carries state-of-the-art tools like laser cutters and 3D printers, alongside versatile, low-cost maker kits. Beyond student residencies, our program is designed for sustainability, including comprehensive professional development for teachers and \"leave-behind\" kits that empower schools to continue making long after our vans depart. Importantly, all of our standards-aligned STEAM residencies are delivered on-site, saving schools and families the logistical and financial burden of off-campus field trips.\n\n## Results in Numbers: A Year of Transformative Impact\n\nThe 2024\u20132025 Mobile Makers Lab program surpassed expectations, demonstrating significant impact across multiple fronts.\n\n*   **Reach & Equity:**\n    *   We served **14 rural schools** across the San Luis Valley through **92 classroom workshops**. This brought direct STEAM engagement to **1,184 students** (grades 4\u20138), exceeding our goal of 1,000 students.\n    *   Our commitment to equity is evident: **83% of participating schools were Title I**, meaning they serve a high percentage of students from low-income families.\n    *   Student demographics reflect the rich diversity of the San Luis Valley: **68% Hispanic/Latine, 27% White, and 5% other.**\n    *   **62% of students qualified for free/reduced-price lunch**, and **9% were students with disabilities**, actively participating with adapted materials.\n*   **Teacher Empowerment:**\n    *   **67 teachers completed 128 hours of professional development**, surpassing our 100-hour goal. This intensive training empowers educators to integrate creative technologies into their curricula.\n    *   A remarkable **73% of trained teachers implemented at least one makers lesson** within 8 weeks of their PD, a substantial increase from our 2023 baseline of 42% and exceeding our 70% goal. This is verified through lesson artifacts submitted by teachers.\n*   **Student Outcomes:**\n    *   Students showed significant growth in creativity and confidence. Their average **Creativity Confidence Scale score (1\u20135) rose from 2.7 to 3.8**, marking a +1.1 increase and exceeding our 3.6 goal (baseline 2.8).\n    *   The maker mindset rubric also saw positive gains, with an average **0.9-point increase** in students' comfort with iteration, problem-solving, and collaboration.\n*   **Efficiency & Sustainability:**\n    *   By delivering programs directly to schools, we estimate **11,200 bus miles were avoided**, a significant cost and environmental saving for rural districts.\n    *   The program achieved an efficient **cost of $58 per student**.\n    *   We provided **14 leave-behind kits per school**, ensuring ongoing access to hands-on learning resources.\n*   **Community Partnerships:**\n    *   We co-designed innovative units with **two school districts**, tailoring experiences to local needs.\n    *   A bilingual (English/Spanish) family night in Alamosa attracted **146 attendees**, fostering family engagement in STEAM learning.\n*   **Teacher Feedback:**\n    *   **94% of teachers rated the residency \"very useful\"** for integrating arts into core subjects, underscoring the program's value in enhancing overall curriculum.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"your-image-url-here/bar-chart-teacher-adoption.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing Mobile Makers Lab teacher adoption rates.

Like many of his peers, he hadn't experienced tools beyond basic classroom supplies. During one residency, the task was to design a small, functional prototype. Julian\u2019s idea was an ingenious seed planter for his family's farm. With guidance from the Mobile Makers Lab educators, he learned to use design software and troubleshoot printing issues.\n\n\"At first, I thought it was too hard,\" Julian shared in Spanish, translated with his parents' consent. \"But then it worked! My planter can help my *pap\u00e1*. I feel proud because I made something useful.\"\n\nJulian\u2019s journey from hesitant observer to confident innovator exemplifies the program's impact. Such experiences foster a \"maker mindset\" \u2013 equipping students with problem-solving skills, resilience, and the belief in their own creative capabilities.\n\n## What\u2019s Next & How You Can Help\n\nThe success of the Mobile Makers Lab in 2024\u20132025 has been phenomenal, yet the demand for this transformative program far outstrips our current capacity. We currently have a waitlist of **6 schools** eager to welcome our mobile labs.\n\n**Our primary goal is to add a third Mobile Makers Lab van**, significantly expanding our reach to more students and communities in the San Luis Valley and beyond. This requires substantial support.\n\n**We invite institutional funders and Colorado corporate CSR teams** to partner with us in this vital expansion. Your sponsorship can directly fund a new Mobile Makers Lab, bringing hands-on STEAM education to thousands more rural students.

      "content": "# Two Vans, 92 Workshops, 1,184 Sparks: How Mobile Makers Lab Brought STEAM to Rural Colorado's San Luis Valley\n\n**By Jasmine Liu, Director of Programs**  \n*Published August 15, 2025*\n\n---\n\nWhen the nearest makerspace is 90 miles away and your students speak Spanish at home more often than English, hands-on learning with laser cutters and 3D printers can feel like a distant dream. But this school year, 1,184 students in grades 4\u20138 across the San Luis Valley didn't have to choose between their rural community and cutting-edge creativity\u2014the Mobile Makers Lab brought both, on wheels.\n\n---\n\n## The Need\n\nThe San Luis Valley\u2014spanning Alamosa, Conejos, Costilla, Mineral, Rio Grande, and Saguache counties\u2014is one of Colorado's most geographically isolated regions. Students in these communities, many from farmworker families and bilingual households, face persistent gaps in access to arts-integrated science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) programming. Eighty-three percent of schools we served this year are Title I, reflecting high concentrations of economic need. Without mobile delivery, families would need to drive hours or forgo maker education entirely.\n\nOur Mobile Makers Lab closes that distance. Two vans outfitted with laser cutters, 3D printers, and low-cost maker kits travel directly to school sites, delivering standards-aligned STEAM residencies, professional development (PD) for teachers, and leave-behind materials so learning continues long after the van departs.\n\n---\n\n## Our Approach\n\nBetween August 2024 and May 2025, the Mobile Makers Lab served **14 rural schools** with **92 classroom workshops**. Each residency was co-designed with district partners to align with Colorado Academic Standards and integrate arts authentically into core subjects like science and math.\n\n**Key program components:**\n\n- **Hands-on workshops** for students in grades 4\u20138, using adapted materials so all learners\u2014including the 9% of participants with disabilities\u2014could engage fully.\n- **Teacher professional development**: 67 educators completed **128 total PD hours**, learning to facilitate maker activities and integrate them into existing curricula.\n- **Leave-behind kits**: Each school received **14 kits** stocked with supplies for independent projects.\n- **Family engagement**: A bilingual (English/Spanish) family maker night in Alamosa drew **146 attendees**, inviting parents and guardians to build alongside their children.\n\nThis model does more than deliver lessons\u2014it builds local capacity. Seventy-three percent of trained teachers implemented at least one new maker lesson within eight weeks, verified through submitted lesson artifacts, surpassing our 70% goal and nearly doubling the 2023 baseline of 42%.\n\n---\n\n## Results in Numbers\n\n**Reach and equity:**\n\n- **1,184 students** participated (goal: 1,000).\n- **68% Hispanic/Latine**, 27% White, 5% other identities.\n- **62%** qualified for free or reduced-price lunch.\n- **83%** of schools served were Title I.\n\n**Teacher impact:**\n\n- **128 PD hours** delivered (goal: 100).\n- **73%** of teachers adopted at least one maker lesson post-residency (baseline: 42%; goal: 70%).\n- **94%** rated the residency \"very useful\" for integrating arts into core subjects.\n\n**Student growth:**\n\n- **Creativity Confidence Scale** (1\u20135) rose from **2.7 to 3.8**\u2014a **1.1-point gain** (baseline: 2.8; goal: 3.6).\n- **Maker mindset rubric** increased **0.9 points**, reflecting stronger problem-solving and collaboration skills.\n\n**Efficiency and sustainability:**\n\n- **11,200 bus miles avoided** by delivering on-site.\n- **$58 cost per student**.\n- **14 leave-behind kits per school**, enabling continued learning.\n\nDemand exceeded capacity: six schools remain on a waitlist for the 2025\u201326 year.\n\n---\n\n## Voices from the Program\n\n*District-approved media releases on file; student pseudonyms used; quotes collected with bilingual parent/guardian consent.*\n\nFifth-grader \"Mateo\" had never used a 3D printer before the Mobile Makers Lab rolled into his school in the southern San Luis Valley. His class designed and printed personalized name tags\u2014some in Spanish, some bilingual\u2014to donate to the local food bank. \"I didn't think I could make something real on a computer,\" Mateo said in Spanish, translated by his teacher. \"Now I want to design something for my abuela.\" His teacher noted that Mateo, usually hesitant to share work aloud, volunteered to present his design to the class\u2014twice.\n\n---\n\n## What's Next and How You Can Help\n\nThis year proved that mobile, bilingual, equity-centered STEAM works. But with six schools waiting and rural Colorado's geography unchanged, we're planning to add a **third Mobile Makers Lab van** in 2026\u2014pending sponsorship.\n\n**Primary call to action:**  \n[**Become a program sponsor**](https://coloradoartsaccess.org/donate) to add a third van and reach 500 more students annually.\n\n**Additional ways to support:**\n\n- **Corporate partners**: Explore custom STEAM sponsorships that align with your community investment goals.

No long bus ride, no lab fee\u2014just hands-on science and art at school for a region where many families work the fields and speak two languages across Alamosa, Conejos, Costilla, Mineral, Rio Grande, and Saguache counties.\n\nThe Need\n- Rural arts education in Colorado often depends on travel to distant museums or labs, creating time and cost barriers for schools and families. The Colorado Department of Education recognizes these access challenges for rural districts.\n- Many students in the San Luis Valley live in bilingual Latine households and have family members working in agriculture. They benefit when STEAM\u2014science, technology, engineering, arts, and math\u2014comes to them in culturally responsive, budget-smart ways.\n- Teachers want practical arts integration professional development (PD) that fits their curriculum and supports diverse learners, including students with disabilities.\n\nOur Approach\nColorado Arts Access (CAA) operates two Mobile Makers Lab vans outfitted with laser cutters, 3D printers, and low-cost maker kits. During the 2024\u20132025 school year (August\u2013May), we delivered:\n- Standards-aligned, multi-day STEAM residencies for grades 4\u20138\n- Teacher PD with planning supports and turnkey lesson plans\n- Co-designed units with two partner districts to tie making to local history, science, and math\n- Leave-behind maker kits so learning continues after we drive away\n- Bilingual (English/Spanish) family engagement nights\n\nWe adapt materials and pacing for person-first inclusion of students with disabilities and collaborate with educators to reflect local culture and language in project prompts.\n\nResults in Numbers\nPlain-language insights, with baselines and goals:\n\n- Schools served: 14 rural schools in the San Luis Valley\n  What it means: We brought the lab to where students learn, reducing travel barriers and time away from class.\n\n- Workshops delivered: 92 classroom workshops\n  Why it matters: Frequent contact helps students move from \u201ctry it once\u201d to true maker habits.\n\n- Students reached: 1,184 students (grades 4\u20138)\n  Baseline/goal: Goal 1,000; actual 1,184. We exceeded our reach goal by 18%, with demand exceeding capacity (waitlist of 6 schools).\n\n- Equity: 83% Title I schools; student demographics 68% Latine, 27% White, 5% other; 62% eligible for free/reduced-price lunch\n  Why it matters: Resources reached communities historically under-resourced in rural arts education, meeting CAA\u2019s equity commitments.\n\n- Inclusion: 9% students with disabilities participated using adapted materials\n  Why it matters: Person-first design and accessible tools ensured all students could prototype and publish their ideas.\n\n- Teacher PD hours: 128 hours for 67 teachers\n  Baseline/goal: Goal 100 hours; actual 128. We surpassed the PD target by 28%, strengthening classroom capacity beyond the residency.\n\n- Teacher lesson adoption: 73% implemented at least one makers lesson within 8 weeks (verified via lesson artifacts)\n  Baseline/goal: Baseline 42%; goal 70%; actual 73%. Teachers turned training into practice at scale, not just intention.\n\n- Student creativity confidence: +1.1 on a 5-point Creativity Confidence Scale (pre 2.7 to post 3.8)\n  Baseline/goal: 2023 baseline 2.8/5; 2024\u201325 goal 3.6; actual 3.8. Students reported greater belief in their creative problem-solving.\n\n- Maker mindset: Rubric increased by 0.9 points\n  Why it matters: Students showed gains in persistence, iteration, and peer feedback.\n\n- Efficiency and sustainability: Estimated 11,200 bus miles avoided by serving on-site; cost per student $58\n  Why it matters: Schools saved time and funds, and students kept learning in their own classrooms.\n\n- Leave-behind kits: 14 per school (196 total)\n  Why it matters: Schools retained tools for continued arts integration, reducing reliance on one-time visits.\n\n- Partnerships and family engagement: Co-designed units with two districts; a bilingual family night in Alamosa welcomed 146 attendees, strengthening school\u2013home connections.\n\nVoices from the Program\nStudent vignette (pseudonym):\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could make something that looks like a real product,\u201d said \u201cMarisol,\u201d a seventh grader who redesigned an irrigation clip for her family\u2019s seed trays after testing 3D-printed options in class. \u201cNow I want to try a version two with a stronger hinge.\u201d District\u2011approved media releases are on file. Student pseudonyms are used. Quotes were collected with bilingual (English/Spanish) parent/guardian consent; no identifiable location details appear in photos without district approval.\n\nTeacher perspective:\n94% of teachers rated the residency \u201cvery useful\u201d for integrating arts into core subjects, citing ready-to-use lesson plans and standards alignment in science and mathematics.\n\nRecommended visuals\n1) Bar chart: Teacher lesson adoption\u2014Baseline 42% (2023) vs. Goal 70% vs. Actual 73% (2024\u201325)\n- Caption: Teachers moved from intention to implementation.\n- Alt text: Simple bar chart showing teacher adoption rising from 42% to 73%, exceeding the 70% goal.\n\n2) Before/after photo set: Student prototype iteration (paper mock-up to laser-cut final)\n- Caption: Iteration in action: students test, learn, and refine.\n- Alt text: Two photos showing a student\u2019s initial paper model and a final laser-cut version, without identifiable location markers.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next/How You Can Help\nDemand exceeded capacity this year, with six rural schools on the waitlist.

      "content": "# Building Resilience, One Home at a Time: StormReady Retrofits Exceed Goals in Harris & Galveston Counties\n\nImagine a senior in your community, facing a sweltering Houston summer or a looming hurricane, feeling safe and comfortable in their own home. For 512 income-qualifying older adults and disabled homeowners across Harris and Galveston Counties, this became a reality thanks to Bayou City Relief & Resilience\u2019s StormReady Home Retrofits program.\n\n## The Need: Facing the Heat and the Storm\n\nThe Greater Houston area, with its unique climate challenges, often leaves our most vulnerable residents at risk. Older adults and individuals with disabilities, especially those on limited incomes, frequently live in homes ill-equipped to handle extreme heat, rising energy costs, or increasingly severe weather events. These challenges can lead to higher utility bills, compromised comfort, and even life-threatening situations during power outages. Our communities deserve to live with dignity and security in their homes, regardless of their income or physical ability.\n\n## Our Approach: A Comprehensive Retrofit for Lasting Impact\n\nThe StormReady Home Retrofits program offers comprehensive, *free* home upgrades to eligible homeowners. Our goal is to create more energy-efficient, comfortable, and resilient homes. Key measures include:\n\n*   **Attic insulation (to R-38):** Keeps homes cooler in summer and warmer in winter.\n*   **Air sealing:** Prevents drafts and outside air from entering, improving energy efficiency.\n*   **Hurricane shutters:** Provides critical protection during severe weather.\n*   **Cool roofing (on qualifying pilot homes):** Reflects sunlight, lowering indoor temperatures.\n*   **Smart thermostats:** Allows for programmable, energy-saving temperature control.\n*   **Small battery backup units:** Powers essential devices during short outages.\n*   **Minor ADA ramp repairs:** Addresses critical accessibility needs.\n\nWe work proactively in flood-prone priority ZIP codes, ensuring our efforts reach those most in need.\n\n## Results in Numbers: January \u2013 June 2025 Highlights\n\nWe are thrilled to share that the first half of 2025 has been a period of significant achievement, exceeding our expectations and bringing tangible benefits to hundreds of Houstonians.\n\n*   **Homes Completed:** We completed retrofits on **512 homes** \u2013 surpassing our goal of 500! Each home retrofit had an average cost of $3,450.\n*   **Energy Savings & Comfort:**\n    *   **Utility Bill Reduction:** Homeowners saw an average **18% reduction** in their utility bills (median $27/month) compared to a 2023 baseline monthly average of $148. This significantly exceeds our 12-15% target.\n    *   **Peak Demand Reduction:** Our homes collectively achieved an average load reduction of **0.8 kW per home**, easing strain on the power grid.\n    *   **Indoor Temperature Stability during Outages:** During a June heat wave, homes with our retrofits maintained indoor temperatures an average of **4.6\u00b0F cooler** than comparison homes during typical 30-60 minute outages, vastly exceeding our >3\u00b0F goal. This means critical comfort and safety when the power goes out.\n    *   **Smart Thermostat Adoption:** Through dedicated education sessions, adoption of energy-saving schedules on smart thermostats jumped from 46% to an impressive **79% within 30 days**.\n*   **Installations Breakdown:**\n    *   Attic Insulation: 512 homes\n    *   Air Sealing: 512 homes\n    *   Smart Thermostats: 512 homes\n    *   Portable Battery Backups: 180 units\n    *   Hurricane Shutters: 122 homes\n    *   Minor ADA Ramp Repairs: 96 homes\n    *   Cool Roof Coatings: 38 homes\n*   **Community Impact & Equity:**\n    *   **Client Demographics:** Our program served **72% Black or Hispanic/Latine-led households**, exceeding our 65% target. Additionally, 61% were female-headed households, and 24% had limited English proficiency (Spanish or Vietnamese).\n    *   **Sense of Safety:** A remarkable **86% of clients reported an \"improved sense of safety\"** in their homes.\n*   **Volunteer Power:** Over 12 build days, **420 dedicated volunteers** contributed their time and skills, with zero OSHA-recordable incidents \u2013 a testament to safety and effective coordination.\n*   **Growing Demand & Efficiency:** While our waitlist remains substantial at 1,137 households, our program improvements have reduced the average wait time from 7.2 months (in 2024) to **3.4 months**.\n*   **Leveraged Resources:** We successfully secured **$87,000 in-kind materials** from corporate partners and matched county recovery funds 1:1, maximizing every dollar.\n\n## Voices from the Program\n\n\"Before BCRR, my electric bill was a constant worry, and I dreaded the thought of another summer power outage,\" shares Ms. Elena Rodriguez, a 72-year-old homeowner from Galveston. \"Now, with the new insulation and my battery backup, I feel so much safer and cooler. It\u2019s a huge relief, a real blessing.\"\n*(Written informed consent on file; HIPAA-limited release for utility/billing data; pseudonyms used; no addresses or house numbers displayed in visuals; quotes approved by clients.)*\n\n## Visualizing Impact\n\n### [Visual 1: Bar Chart \u2013 Utility Bill Reduction]\n\n**Caption:** Average Monthly Utility Bill Reduction for StormReady Home Retrofit Participants (Jan-Jun 2025). This chart shows the significant financial relief experienced by homeowners post-retrofit.\n**Alt Text:** Bar chart showing an average 18% reduction ($27/month) in utility bills for StormReady Home Retrofit participants compared to a 2023 baseline.\n\n### [Visual 2: Before/After Photo \u2013 Home with new Hurricane Shutters]\n\n**Caption:** Before and After: A StormReady home in Houston with newly installed hurricane shutters.

      "content": "# How 512 Houston-Area Homes Stayed Cool and Safe Through the 2025 Summer Heat Wave\n\n**By Daniela Reyes, Communications Director**  \n*Published: July 22, 2025*\n\n**URL slug:** `/stormready-home-retrofits-jan-june-2025-results`\n\n**Meta description:** StormReady Home Retrofits completed 512 homes in Greater Houston, cutting energy bills 18% and keeping vulnerable residents safer during outages. See results.\n\n---\n\nWhen the lights go out in Houston, every degree matters. During the June heat wave, homes retrofitted through our StormReady program stayed 4.6\u00b0F cooler than comparison homes during 30\u201360 minute outages\u2014a margin that can mean the difference between discomfort and medical emergency for older adults and people with disabilities.\n\n---\n\n## The Need\n\nGreater Houston's older adults and disabled homeowners face a triple threat: aging housing stock that bleeds heat and air conditioning, extreme weather events that knock out power with increasing frequency, and rising utility bills that force impossible choices between cooling and groceries. In flood-prone neighborhoods across Harris and Galveston Counties, many homes lack basic weatherization, hurricane protection, or backup power for critical medical devices.\n\nThe [StormReady Home Retrofit program](https://bcrr.org/stormready-retrofits) addresses all three challenges at once, at no cost to income-qualifying homeowners aged 60 and older or people with disabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Our Approach\n\nBetween January and June 2025, Bayou City Relief & Resilience teams installed seven types of resilience measures:\n\n- **Attic insulation** upgraded to R-38 standard (512 homes)\n- **Air sealing** to reduce drafts and energy loss (512 homes)\n- **Hurricane shutters** for storm protection (122 homes)\n- **Cool roof coatings** on pilot homes to reflect heat (38 homes)\n- **Smart thermostats** with personalized setup (512 homes)\n- **Portable battery backups** for medical devices and phones (180 homes)\n- **Minor ADA ramp repairs** to improve accessibility (96 homes)\n\nEach retrofit is customized based on home audit results, health needs, and client preference. The average cost per home was $3,450, funded through county recovery dollars matched 1:1 with private donations and $87,000 in materials donated by corporate partners.\n\n[Volunteer teams](https://bcrr.org/volunteer) completed installations over 12 build days with zero OSHA-recordable safety incidents\u2014a record we're proud to maintain.\n\n---\n\n## Results in Numbers\n\n**We exceeded our six-month target, completing 512 homes against a goal of 500.**\n\n### Energy and cost savings\n\nHomeowners are saving real money. Compared to their 2023 baseline utility bills (average $148/month), retrofitted homes saw an **18% reduction**\u2014a median savings of **$27 per month**. That beats our 12\u201315% target and puts an extra $324 back in household budgets each year.\n\nIndependent measurement and verification by Frontier Energy confirmed an average **peak demand reduction of 0.8 kilowatts per home**, easing strain on the grid during high-demand periods.\n\n### Safety and comfort during outages\n\nWhen CenterPoint Energy experienced rolling outages during the June heat wave, in-home sensors in 68 retrofitted homes recorded indoor temperatures **4.6\u00b0F lower** than comparison homes during the first hour without power. For someone managing diabetes, heart disease, or heat sensitivity, those degrees can prevent a trip to the emergency room.\n\n**86% of clients reported an \"improved sense of safety\"** in post-installation surveys, citing hurricane shutters, battery backups, and simply knowing their home could hold cool air longer.\n\n### Who we served\n\nThis program centers equity. Of the 512 households:\n\n- **72% are Black or Hispanic/Latine-led households** (goal: 65%)\n- **61% are headed by women**\n- **24% have limited English proficiency**, primarily Spanish or Vietnamese speakers\n- **100% are in priority ZIP codes** identified for flood risk and energy burden\n\nWe provided intake materials and installation instructions in Spanish and Vietnamese, and staff interpreters were available at every appointment.\n\n### Growing demand\n\nOur waitlist stands at **1,137 households**\u2014proof of unmet need\u2014but we've cut average wait time from 7.2 months in 2024 to **3.4 months** in 2025 by streamlining intake and expanding volunteer capacity.\n\n**420 volunteers** contributed skilled labor, logistics support, and client education over the six-month period.\n\n---\n\n## Voices from the Program\n\n**Mar\u00eda V.**, a 68-year-old homeowner in southeast Houston, lives with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and depends on a nebulizer. Before her retrofit, she avoided running the AC to keep bills under $180. After insulation, air sealing, a smart thermostat, and a battery backup unit were installed, her June bill dropped to $142\u2014and she breathes easier in more ways than one.\n\n> \"When the power went out last month, my nebulizer kept working because of that little battery. I didn't have to panic. And my house stayed cool enough that I could just wait it out. That's peace of mind.\"\n\nMar\u00eda also attended a smart thermostat education session, where she learned to set an energy-saving schedule. Across the program, those 30-minute workshops boosted adoption of efficient schedules from 46% to 79% within 30 days\u2014turning technology into tangible savings.\n\n*Written informed consent on file; HIPAA-limited release for utility/billing data; pseudonyms used; no addresses or house numbers displayed in visuals; quotes approved by clients.*\n\n---\n\n## What's Next and How You Can Help\n\nWe're heading into peak hurricane season with over 1,100 households still waiting for retrofits that could keep them safe and comfortable during the next storm.\n\n### Donate to retrofit a home before peak hurricane season\n\n**[$3,450 retrofits one home](https://bcrr.org/donate?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=stormready_jan_jun_2025) with insulation, air sealing, a smart thermostat, and safety measures.** Every dollar is matched 1:1 by county recovery funds, doubling your impact. Smaller gifts add up\u2014$27 covers one month of energy savings for a household, and $180 provides a battery backup for critical medical devices.\n\n### Join a build day\n\n[Corporate volunteer teams and skilled individuals](https://bcrr.org/volunteer?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=stormready_jan_jun_2025) are welcome.
