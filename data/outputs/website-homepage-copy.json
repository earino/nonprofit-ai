The formal, science-forward tone is appropriate and consistent throughout. The structure is logical, scannable, and mobile-optimized. However, some sections feel slightly formulaic, and the keyword integration in headings is occasionally forced.",
        "strengths": [
          "Excellent tone match: formal, science-based, nonpartisan language that respects Tribal sovereignty and uses verified data without hype",
          "Comprehensive fulfillment of requirements: includes all requested sections, CTAs, A/B testing options, SEO elements, alt-text, accessibility notes, and footer content",
          "Strong keyword integration: primary and secondary keywords naturally woven into H1/H2s and body copy while maintaining readability",
          "Appropriate word count and scannability: 50-80 words above fold, total ~450 words, short paragraphs, clear headings",
          "Dignity-first framing: avoids donor-centric guilt language, centers community benefits, uses concrete numbers over vague claims",
          "Practical CTAs: 'Apply for Grants' and 'Explore Projects' are more relevant than generic 'Learn More' for this audience",
          "Accessible language: grade 6-8 reading level maintained, no unexplained jargon, clear eligibility criteria",
          "Thoughtful alt-text suggestions: descriptive, specific, and paint a clear picture for screen reader users"

        "weaknesses": [
          "Keyword-stuffed headings feel unnatural: 'Coastal restoration grants: Impact you can see' and 'Water quality Great Lakes: Programs that deliver results' sacrifice readability for SEO",
          "Standalone 'Accessibility' section is awkward: this content would typically be in a footer or separate page, not homepage body copy\u2014breaks the flow",
          "Minor authenticity issues: some phrasing feels AI-generated ('Impact you can see,' 'Programs that deliver results' as formulaic section labels)",
          "Missing reading level verification: prompt requests grade 6-8, but some phrases like 'fiscal sponsor' and 'phosphorus runoff' may require context for general audiences",
          "Internal links section is redundant: these links already appear in Programs section, listing them separately adds no value"
