      "content": "Prepared by Maya Ortiz, Development Coordinator for Executive Director + Board Fundraising Committee on November 2, 2025\n\n## 1) EXECUTIVE SNAPSHOT\n\nHills & Hollers Food Collective seeks to raise $20,000 net to expand mobile pantry routes, directly addressing rural food insecurity in Kentucky's Appalachian coalfield counties. Our target audience \u2014 local supporters aged 30-65, including small business owners, church groups, teachers, and community-minded families (HHI $40K-$80K) \u2014 are vital to our success. We aim for 125-175 in-person attendees and $7,500 from 4-6 local sponsors. Key constraints include a modest budget under $5,000, limited staff time (ED 5 hrs/wk, PT Dev Coord 8 hrs/wk, volunteer coord 5 hrs/wk), and the need for a weather-resilient, accessible event in Spring 2025 (April/May), avoiding local competing events. Every dollar raised directly supports delivering fresh produce and staples to hollers without grocery access, ensuring our mission remains at the heart of our efforts. We'll feature client stories, highlight our mobile pantry truck, and invite local farmers, all while ensuring full accessibility.\n\n## 2) EVENT CONCEPT PORTFOLIO\n\n**1.

Sponsoring assets: \"Harvest Table\" sponsors, \"Farmer Spotlight\" segments.\n- Cost Drivers: Catering/ingredients, venue rental, speaker/entertainment.\n- Capacity Intensity: MEDIUM \u2013 requires significant coordination for food sourcing and preparation but relies on existing farmer networks.\n\n**2. Holler Hops & Hymns (Hybrid)**\n- Tagline/Theme: Connecting hearts and hands across our hills and hollers for food security.\n- Mission Connection: Funds mobile pantry expansion by uniting community members through shared cultural experience, fostering a sense of collective responsibility for food access.\n- Audience Fit: Engages church groups, families and community members who appreciate music, storytelling, and local heritage, offering a warm and welcoming social environment.\n- Experience: An evening of local bluegrass/Gospel music, featuring church choirs and local musicians.

Its strong community appeal and authentic nature are perfect for engaging our target audience and organically reaching the $20K net goal through broad participation and low overhead.\n- Key Risks: Perceived as \"too casual\" or not a \"fundraiser\"; potential for too few high-value donations. Quality and consistency of potluck dishes can be unpredictable.\n- Mitigations: Emphasize the \"suggested donation\" and \"Sponsor a Main Dish\" corporate opportunities. Frame it as a \"Community Gathering for Good\" to set expectations. Clearly communicate the mission impact and how every contribution, large or small, expands mobile pantry routes. Provide clear, simple guidelines for potluck contributions and consider a \"best dish\" informal contest.\n- Quick Win Potential: Test with a smaller-scale \"Friends & Family Potluck\" to gather feedback on atmosphere, suggested donation levels, and volunteer support needs.\n\n**2. Appalachia Unplugged: Acoustic Storytelling & Supper**\n- Why This Concept: This event offers profound mission alignment by placing client stories and authentic experiences at its core, fostering deep empathy in a low-cost, high-impact format (LOW Capacity Intensity). Its unique focus on intimate storytelling and cultural preservation provides strong differentiation while resonating deeply with community-minded families and church groups, offering a sophisticated yet accessible experience for high net revenue.\n- Key Risks: Reliance on compelling storytellers and musicians; marketing can be challenging for an intimate event; potential for emotional intensity to be overwhelming for some guests.\n- Mitigations: Recruit and train storytellers well in advance, offering support and ensuring diverse voices. Partner with local cultural organizations or churches for talent. Offer a designated calm space, and frame the storytelling as \"resilience and hope\" to balance emotional depth. Ensure professional sound for acoustic performances.\n- Quick Win Potential: Host a \"storytelling circle\" with a few key individuals and a small audience to refine the format and gather initial feedback on impact and narrative flow.\n\n**3. \"A Meal, A Mile\" Mobile Pantry Truck Tour & Tasting**\n- Why This Concept: This event brilliantly highlights our mobile pantry truck, a tangible asset directly connecting donors to our mission of expanding routes, offering strong mission alignment and differentiation. It allows for a tactile, educational experience that is feasible within our budget and staff capacity (LOW Capacity Intensity), drawing in families and new supporters by showing them exactly where their money goes.\n- Key Risks: Weather dependency for an outdoor event; ensuring enough compelling food samples and interactive elements; managing crowd flow around the truck.\n- Mitigations: Secure a rain-backup venue (e.g., covered pavilion or nearby community center). Partner with local farmers and food businesses for diverse and appealing samples. Clearly mark stations and have enthusiastic volunteers guide attendees, ensuring the truck tour flows smoothly and highlights key features and routes.\n- Quick Win Potential: Conduct a \"Mobile Pantry Preview\" for board members, key partners, and a few community influencers, testing the truck tour narrative and food sample logistics on a small scale.\n\n## 5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\n**Potential Partners/Hosts:**\n*   **Venues:** Pikeville Commons (shopping center for parking lot events), local high school gyms/auditoriums, First Presbyterian Church of Pikeville, Wayland Community Center, Pikeville College (for lecture halls or shared spaces), local farms with event barns (e.g., Mayking Farms, if accessible).\n*   **Community Orgs:** Cooperative Extension Service (for gardening/food prep workshops, farmer connections), Pikeville Farmers Market (for ingredient sourcing, farmer participation, event space), Appalachian Regional Healthcare (health/nutrition info, sponsorship, audience reach), local churches (venue hosts, volunteer recruitment, potluck participants).

Hands-on activity appeals to churches, teachers, and families; highlights the truck and client storytellers.\n- Key Risks: Venue availability; box supply sourcing; paddle-raise underperforms.\n- Mitigations: Secure church gym hold by Week 2; confirm in-kind boxes/food with partners; pre-commit 2\u20133 match sponsors to anchor paddle raise.\n- Quick Win Potential: Pilot a 30-person micro-pack with board and champions to refine run-of-show and test pledge language.\n\n2) Fuel the Truck: Radio-Livestream Telethon\n- Why This Concept: Low-cost, scalable reach via radio and social; complements an in-person night to close the gap to $20K net. Weather-proof and capacity-light.\n- Key Risks: Weak on-air engagement; tech glitches; sponsor reluctance.\n- Mitigations: Script compelling 3-minute client story; rehearse with station; secure a dollar-for-dollar match hour; pre-seed gifts to show momentum.\n- Quick Win Potential: Run a 20-minute \u201cmini-telethon\u201d Facebook Live test during a pantry day to validate engagement and giving tools.\n\n3) Bluegrass & Biscuits Brunch Benefit\n- Why This Concept: Familiar, family-friendly format with clear ticket value; easy to sell $7.5K in sponsorships (table, biscuit bar, music). Indoors, weather-safe, accessible.\n- Key Risks: Food costs; Sunday schedule conflicts; volunteer food service load.\n- Mitigations: In-kind biscuit mix/eggs/jams from farmers and grocers; choose late-morning slot; use pre-portioning and self-serve stations to reduce volunteer strain.\n- Quick Win Potential: Host a taste test with one church group and a local band to capture photos/video and secure early table captains.\n\n\n5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\nPotential Partners/Hosts\n- Venues: Pike County Extension Service kitchen/classrooms; Appalachian Regional Healthcare conference space; Pikeville Public Library auditorium/gallery; local church gyms (e.g., First Baptist, Saint Francis); Big Sandy Community & Technical College culinary lab; City of Pikeville Event Center.\n- Program/Community: Cooperative Extension Service (workshops, venue); Pikeville Farmers Market (vendor recruiting); Appalachian Regional Healthcare (venue, health sponsors); local churches (pack night teams); High school FFA and culinary programs (chef throwdown support).\n- Media/In-Kind: WEKB/WEKU/WDHR local radio; Appalachian News-Express; community Facebook groups; Food City/Kroger/Save-A-Lot (in-kind staples); Pepsi/Buffalo Trace (non-alc beverage or sponsorship); local print shop.\n\nTalent/MC Ideas\n- MC: Popular local radio host or school superintendent (trusted, calm presence).\n- Music: A local bluegrass trio (e.g., student ensembles from high school/college).\n- Speakers: Client storyteller (prepped/supportive), a route driver, and a farmer from Pikeville Farmers Market.\n- Auctioneer/Paddle-Raise Caller: Respected pastor or retired judge who commands the room.\n\nSponsorship Hooks\n- Naming Tiers: Presenting \u201cRoute Builder\u201d ($5,000), \u201cFuel the Truck\u201d ($2,500), \u201cHarvest Partner\u201d ($1,000), \u201cHoller Friend\u201d ($500).\n- Sponsored Segments: Accessibility Sponsor (ASL/Spanish/low-sensory setup), Route County Sponsors (named tables or stations), Biscuit Bar Sponsor, Chef Basket Sponsor, Livestream Sponsor, Matching Gift Sponsor.\n- Tangible Assets: Stage/podium branding, truck wrap decal strip for high-tier sponsors, tasting bracelet logos, program ads, social shout-outs, digital thermometers (miles funded).\n\nBeneficiary/Volunteer Involvement\n- Authentic Roles: Client speakers co-develop stories; farmers host a \u201cWhat\u2019s in Season\u201d table; volunteers lead packing lanes; route drivers narrate a 2-minute \u201cday-in-the-life.\u201d\n- Beyond Logistics: Host committee of 10\u201312 to secure tables and peer-to-peer pledges; church team captains; sponsor liaison volunteers; accessibility ambassadors to welcome guests and offer interpreter headsets.\n\n\n6) NEXT STEPS & DECISION TIMELINE\n\nQuick-Win Pilots\n- Micro Pack & Pledge: 30 people at the Extension gym; test 15-minute program + pledge cards; aim for $5,000 in pre-committed matches.\n- Mini Livestream: 20-minute Facebook/Radio cross-stream during a pantry stop; test text-to-give and match message.\n\nValidation Plan (4\u20136 Questions for 10\u201312 Stakeholders)\n- Which concept excites you enough to invite friends or your church group?\n- What ticket price feels right for a 90-minute indoor fundraiser ($25, $30, $35, $40)?\n- Would your business sponsor a route mile, a table, or a match hour? At what level?\n- Preferred day/time in April\u2013May (Thursday evening, Saturday afternoon, Sunday brunch)?\n- What accessibility features are most important to you/your family?\n- Would you volunteer to captain a table or peer-to-peer page?\n\nDecision Timeline\n- Weeks 1\u20132: Gather input (calls to top donors/church leaders; quick online survey).\n- Week 3: Select primary concept (Pack & Pledge Night) + add Telethon and Brunch as revenue boosters.\n- Week 4: Kickoff planning; lock venue/date; launch sponsor outreach.\n\n90-Day Pre-Approval Tasks\n- Venue holds and contingency back-up (ADA-verified).\n- Budget model with best/base/worst scenarios; expense cap <$5,000.\n- Sponsor prospect list (20\u201325) + packages and one-pagers.\n- Staffing/volunteer plan with defined roles (host committee, accessibility ambassadors, phone bank).\n- Accessibility plan (wheelchair layout, low-sensory corner, bilingual interpretation).\n- Risk/contingency (power/AV backup, inclement weather plan even if indoor).\n- Initial marketing timeline (save-the-date at T-8 weeks; sponsor announcements; client story teasers; radio cross-promotion).\n\nPrepared by Maya Ortiz, Development Coordinator for Executive Director + Board Fundraising Committee on November 2, 2025",

Hosts become fundraisers, reducing staff burden. Total net revenue potential of $12K\u201318K from 6\u20138 concerts fits your $20K goal when combined with sponsorships. Ultra-low overhead (under $800 total) preserves budget for mobile pantry expansion. The intimate setting naturally facilitates storytelling and highlights the mobile pantry mission authentically. Bluegrass music honors regional culture without replicating the barn dance's high volunteer lift.\n\n**Key Risks:** Host recruitment may lag; inconsistent guest turnout per concert; musician availability in rural area.\n\n**Mitigations:** Recruit 2\u20133 \"champion hosts\" early (board members, business owners) who model commitment. Provide host toolkit (invitation templates, suggested guest lists, talking points). Set minimum guest commitments (6 per concert). Partner with local musicians early; offer small stipends ($100\u2013150) or in-kind appreciation. Schedule concerts on consecutive Fridays/Saturdays to maintain momentum.\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Pilot with ONE concert in late March at board member's home; test logistics, refine toolkit, gauge revenue ($500\u2013800 proof-of-concept). If successful, scale to 6\u20138 concerts April\u2013May. Minimal upfront investment; immediate feedback loop.\n\n---\n\n### **#2: SEEDS & STORIES GARDEN PARTY** (Score: 22)\n\n**Why This Concept:** Aligns perfectly with May timing (post-frost, pre-county fair), outdoor setting, and educational mission. The Extension Service partnership provides venue, credibility, and volunteer support, reducing staff load. Garden theme resonates deeply with your rural audience's values and skills, differentiating from cook-offs and fish fries. Sponsorship of seed packets creates tangible donor connection. Revenue potential of $18K\u201322K net achievable through 150 attendees \u00d7 $32 average + $7,500 sponsorships + auction. Weather backup (tent) addresses risk tolerance.\n\n**Key Risks:** Weather dependency; outdoor accessibility challenges; volunteer coordination for multiple activity stations.\n\n**Mitigations:** Secure large tent rental early (negotiate in-kind from sponsor); choose Extension demo garden with paved paths and accessible parking; recruit 15\u201320 volunteers from church groups and assign clear station roles 4 weeks out. Schedule rain date or move entirely under tent if forecast poor. Leverage Extension staff for garden content/demos.\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Partner with Extension to host a mini \"Seed Swap Saturday\" in March (30\u201340 people, free, story + seeds). Test storytelling format, gauge interest, build email list. Use feedback to refine May event. Cost under $200.\n\n---\n\n### **#3: MOBILE MARKET CELEBRATION & AUCTION** (Score: 22)\n\n**Why This Concept:** The mobile pantry truck as centerpiece directly connects donors to mission impact\u2014visual, tangible, memorable. Auction format is familiar to your small business owner demographic and generates strong net revenue ($15K\u201320K achievable). Outdoor market vibe feels celebratory, not obligatory. Sponsorable assets (truck tours, auction categories, food vendors) easily reach $7,500 target. April/May timing works; outdoor venue with tent backup manages weather risk.\n\n**Key Risks:** Auction logistics (item procurement, bidding management); weather; volunteer capacity for setup/breakdown.\n\n**Mitigations:** Recruit volunteer auction committee (3\u20134 people) in January to solicit 50+ items from farmers, businesses, artisans. Use simple paper bidding (no costly software) or free Google Forms for pre-bidding. Secure tent and tables early. Tap church volunteers for day-of setup (4-hour shifts). Create detailed run-of-show and assign roles.\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Test auction appeal with small \"Basket Raffle\" at February board meeting or church gathering\u201410 baskets, $5 tickets, track what sells. Validates donor appetite. Partner with Farmers Market to co-promote and source auction items early.\n\n---\n\n## 5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\n### **Potential Partners/Hosts**\n\n**Venues:**\n- University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service (Pike County office and demo garden\u2014accessible, mission-aligned, AV capable)\n- First Baptist Church Pikeville, Shiloh United Methodist, St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church (fellowship halls, accessible parking, volunteer base)\n- Pikeville City Park pavilion (outdoor, accessible, central)\n- Local farms with accessible barn/outdoor spaces (for Breakfast on Farm or Garden Party)\n- Pike County Public Library meeting room (Film Night, smaller gatherings)\n\n**Community Partners:**\n- **Cooperative Extension Service**: Co-host garden/farm events;

Which event concept appeals most to you, and why?\n2. What ticket price feels accessible for you and your family/colleagues? ($15? $25? $40?)\n3. Would you attend an outdoor May event? What would make you comfortable (tent, accessible parking, kids' activities)?\n4. Would you consider hosting a small house concert or watch party? Why or why not?\n5. How do you prefer to hear about our mission\u2014stories, data, tours, videos?\n6. What local businesses or community groups should we partner with?\n\n**Methods:** 10-minute phone calls (15 people); online survey (email to 100+ contacts); focus group at February church potluck (8\u201310 attendees).\n\n---\n\n### **Decision Timeline**\n\n- **Week 1\u20132 (Nov 4\u201315)**: Board and staff review concepts; distribute validation survey; conduct 10 phone interviews\n- **Week 3 (Nov 18\u201322)**: Compile feedback; development coordinator presents top 3 recommendations with pilot results to board committee\n- **Week 4 (Nov 25)**: Board approves primary event + optional pilot; authorize budget and timeline\n- **Week 5 (Dec 2)**: Kickoff planning; assign roles; begin sponsor prospecting\n\n---\n\n### **90-Day Pre-Approval Tasks (December\u2013February)**\n\n1. **Venue Holds**: Contact Extension, churches, farms for May date holds; confirm accessibility features; negotiate in-kind/reduced rates. *Owner: Volunteer Coordinator, by Dec 15.*\n\n2. **Budget Model**: Build detailed expense and revenue spreadsheet for chosen concept; identify cost-saving opportunities; set net revenue target. *Owner: Development Coordinator, by Dec 20.*\n\n3. **Sponsor Prospecting List + Packages**: Identify 15\u201320 prospect businesses/individuals; create 1-page sponsorship menu with tiers and benefits; draft ask emails/letters. *Owner: ED + Development Coordinator, by Jan 10.*\n\n4. **Staffing/Volunteer Plan**: Recruit host committee or volunteer leads (auction, setup, etc.); create volunteer job descriptions and timeline; schedule training sessions. *Owner: Volunteer Coordinator, by Jan 20.*\n\n5. **Accessibility Plan**: Confirm venue accessibility audit; arrange Spanish interpretation; design low-sensory space; finalize sliding-scale policy and scholarship process. *Owner: Development Coordinator + accessibility advisor, by Jan 30.*\n\n6. **Risk/Contingency**: Identify top 5 risks (weather, low ticket sales, sponsor shortfall, volunteer gaps, tech failures); create mitigation plan for each; set \"go/no-go\" decision point (March 15). *Owner: ED, by Feb 1.*\n\n7. **Initial Marketing Timeline**: Draft save-the-date, create event Facebook page, schedule email blasts, pitch to WMMT radio and local papers, design print postcards. *Owner: Development Coordinator, by Feb 10.*\n\n---\n\n*This brainstorm provides a menu of tested, accessible, mission-rich options. Combining a primary event (e.g., Seeds & Stories Garden Party) with a low-lift pilot (Porch Concert or Gratitude Gathering) and a digital component (Lightning Challenge or Virtual Storytelling Night) could diversify risk and maximize your $20K goal while honoring capacity constraints. The community is ready to gather\u2014let's give them a table worth coming to.*",

Journeys to Code: Storytelling & Sponsorship Supper**\n- Why This Concept: This concept is highly effective for engaging new major donor prospects due to its intimate, mission-driven storytelling format. It offers a direct, emotional connection to WCCB's impact, which is crucial for high-net-worth individuals. The focused format minimizes logistical complexity, fitting our team's capacity while maximizing net revenue potential through high-value table sponsorships and pledges.\n- Key Risks: Relying on a smaller, higher-ticket attendance means fewer overall attendees; potential for the event to feel exclusive rather than inclusive for some audiences; securing compelling alumni speakers.\n- Mitigations: Offer a virtual \"story stream\" or post-event video; ensure diverse representation on host committee and invite list; work closely with alumni for storytelling coaching; proactively identify and train host committee members to make all guests feel welcome.\n- Quick Win Potential: Host a small, similar dinner with current board members and top donors to test the format and gather feedback on storytelling effectiveness before a larger launch.\n\n**2. Code & Connect: Tech for Good Mixer**\n- Why This Concept: This concept brilliantly balances revenue generation, employer visibility, and donor engagement through direct networking. Its interactive, modern format appeals strongly to our target audience of tech professionals and HR leaders, differentiating it from traditional events. The hybrid component broadens reach, and its structure allows for multiple sponsorship opportunities.\n- Key Risks: Ensuring genuine connections rather than superficial networking; managing attendee flow in a hybrid environment; initial tech setup for digital portfolio displays.\n- Mitigations: Provide icebreakers and structured intros; dedicated virtual hosts to moderate chats and facilitate connections; have technical support on-site; provide clear instructions for alumni portfolio creation.\n- Quick Win Potential: Organize a smaller \"speed networking\" session with a few key employers and WCCB alumni to refine the format and gather testimonials.\n\n**3. The Tech Navigator Race: Urban Exploration & Career Quest**\n- Why This Concept: This concept offers exceptional creative differentiation and scalability while engaging a younger, active tech professional audience. It's a low-cost, high-engagement way to raise visibility and attract new philanthropic interest from a demographic interested in experiential giving. Its community-oriented nature strengthens WCCB\u2019s local ties.\n- Key Risks: Weather dependency for an outdoor event; ensuring accessibility for all checkpoints; potential for logistic complexity with multiple race points.\n- Mitigations: Have a rain date or accessible indoor alternative; pre-scout all routes for ADA compliance and provide clear, varied difficulty routes; utilize a strong volunteer corps and mobile app for real-time coordination.\n- Quick Win Potential: Pilot a smaller \"mini-race\" within a single tech campus or neighborhood with WCCB staff, alumni, and host committee as participants to test the concept and app functionality.\n\n### 5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\n**Potential Partners/Hosts:**\n*   **Venues:** 1871 (tech hub), tech-forward hotel conference spaces in River North (e.g., The Godfrey, Holiday Inn Mart Plaza), Fulton Market event lofts (e.g., Morgan Manufacturing, City Winery), City Colleges of Chicago facilities (for specific programming/classrooms).\n*   **Community Orgs:** ICIRR (immigrant/refugee support), local dev meetup groups (ChicagoJS, PyLadies Chicago), ChiTech Academy (youth development aligns with talent pipeline story).\n*   **Media Partners:** Built In Chicago, Crain's Chicago Business (tech section), local tech blogs/podcasts, Block Club Chicago (community engagement stories).\n*   **In-Kind Sources:** Tech companies for venue donation, AV equipment, food/beverage donations for informal components, printing services.\n\n**Talent/MC Ideas:**\n*   **Brendan Reilly:** Alderman, experienced public speaker, tech-friendly.\n*   **Maria Contreras-Sweet:** Former White House SBA Administrator, advocate for entrepreneurship/immigrant communities.

It successfully balances creative differentiation with practical constraints, offering genuinely distinct concepts rather than generic templates. Minor weaknesses include some ambitious assumptions about sponsorship revenue relative to budget and a few concepts that may require more capacity than indicated.",
        "strengths": [
          "Exceptional concept diversity with genuine creative differentiation - concepts like 'Tech Navigator Race,' 'Code Canvas,' and 'Passport to Tech' avoid clich\u00e9s and offer fresh approaches that align authentically with the mission",
          "Thorough accessibility integration throughout every concept, not as an afterthought but as a core design element (CART/ASL, halal/vegetarian, sliding scale, gender-neutral restrooms consistently addressed)",
          "Strong mission alignment with concrete connections - each concept explicitly ties back to immigrant/refugee tech talent pipeline rather than generic fundraising language",
          "Practical, actionable implementation support including specific Chicago venues (1871, Fulton Market), realistic local partners (ICIRR, ChiTech Academy), and concrete pilot ideas",
          "Excellent use of casual tone as requested - approachable, energizing language without sacrificing professionalism ('Mavericks,' 'Walkabout,' conversational headers)",
          "Realistic capacity assessments with honest HIGH ratings for complex events like the gala and festival, helping decision-makers understand true resource requirements",
          "Strong comparison matrix that provides genuine differentiation in scoring rather than inflating all concepts equally",

        "weaknesses": [
          "Sponsorship goal of $60K against a $25-35K budget is ambitious but not explicitly addressed as a constraint or risk - the concepts don't clearly show how to achieve nearly 2:1 sponsorship-to-expense ratio",
          "Some capacity intensity ratings may be optimistic - 'Tech Navigator Race' rated LOW but requires app development, insurance, multiple checkpoint coordination, and significant volunteer management which typically demands MEDIUM capacity",
          "The 'Immigrant Innovations Gala (Reimagined)' concept, while attempting differentiation, still carries high production costs and complexity that may not sufficiently distinguish it from the 'avoid gala look/feel' constraint",
          "Minor inconsistency: Executive Snapshot mentions 'particpants' (typo) and the document occasionally uses jargon like 'HHI' without defining it, though context makes it clear"

Strong path to $60K sponsorship via \u201cCommitment Counter,\u201d Apprenticeship Zone, and Presenting tiers.\n- Key Risks: Employer hesitation to pledge publicly; program runs long; AV complexity.\n- Mitigations: Pre-secure 2\u20133 anchor pledges; script to 75 minutes; experienced producer; tech checks; visible timers.\n- Quick Win Potential: Pilot a mini pitch at a Lunch & Learn to test flow and commitment framing.\n\n2) Hiring Sprints & Skills Showcase\n- Why This Concept: Converts relationships to interviews fast; monetizable employer packages; measurable outcomes that wow donors and board.\n- Key Risks: Matching quality; no-shows; employer fatigue.\n- Mitigations: Pre-event screening + scheduling; waitlist mechanics; 1:1 concierge for VIP employers; 7-minute sprints with buffers.\n- Quick Win Potential: Run a 60-minute micro-sprint with 5 employers at 1871 to refine format and data capture.\n\n3) BridgeWorks: Rooftop Tech + Talent Night\n- Why This Concept: Broad appeal for 200\u2013250 guests, easy donor hosting, festival vibe without gala costs. Strong ticket sales + branded demo pods drive net revenue.\n- Key Risks: Weather/backup plan; F&B costs; noise management for accessibility.\n- Mitigations: Choose indoor/terrace venue; negotiated F&B minimums; directional audio + captioned screens; quiet room.\n- Quick Win Potential: Host-committee \u201crooftop preview\u201d with 40 guests to test demos, signage, and pledge moment.\n\n5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\nPotential Partners/Hosts\n- Venues: 1871 (Merchandise Mart), TechNexus (225 W Wacker), mHUB (N Milwaukee Ave), Morgan MFG, Venue West, Convene (333 N Green), The Mart conference floors, sponsor offices in Fulton Market (Google, Salesforce Tower lounges, Motor Row options).\n- Community/Program Partners: 1871, ChiTech Academy, ICIRR, City Colleges of Chicago, P33, i.c.stars, World Relief Chicago, Erie Neighborhood House, Chicago Refugee Coalition, local dev meetup groups (ChicagoJS, ChiHackNight).\n- Media/In-kind: Built In Chicago, Chicago Inno/Crain\u2019s, WBEZ/Vocalo, Technori, The TRiiBE; AV partners (Sound Investment, Meeting Tomorrow); printing (Cushing); captioning/ASL vendors (CART Providers Chicago, Deaf Communication by Innovations).\n\nTalent/MC Ideas\n- Betsy Ziegler (CEO, 1871) as host/interviewer.\n- Neal Sales-Griffin (tech educator/founder) for lightning talks moderation.\n- Sandee Kastrul (i.c.stars) as awards presenter or roundtable co-facilitator.\n- Adam Burke (Wait Wait\u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me!\u2014Chicago-based comic and immigrant) as light-touch MC with mission tie-in.\n- Alumni storytellers representing varied countries/tech tracks; employer champions from Grubhub, Relativity, Salesforce, Thoughtworks.\n\nSponsorship Hooks\n- Naming Tiers: Presenting ($25K), Impact ($15K), Community Champion ($10K), Accessibility ($7.5K), Talent Matching ($5K), Demo Pod ($2.5K).\n- Sponsored Segments: Employer Roundtable, Commitment Counter, Accessibility (CART/ASL), Livestream Studio, Apprenticeship Marketplace, Quiet Room, Culinary Story Stations.\n- Tangible Assets: Stage/digital branding, stream lower-thirds, badge/lanyard branding (with pronoun indicators), tasting passports, demo pod wraps, program ads, VIP green room.\n\nBeneficiary/Volunteer Involvement\n- Alumni roles: demo leads, storytellers, pitch teams, advisory reviewers for employer criteria, on-stage co-hosts.\n- Volunteers: host committee as table captains/peer fundraisers; tech-community ambassadors to staff demo pods; virtual chat moderators; employer concierge team; data capture for commitments.\n\n6) NEXT STEPS & DECISION TIMELINE\n\nQuick-Win Pilots\n- Mini Pitch + Commitment Counter: 45-minute segment at a Lunch & Learn with 2 alumni teams and 3 employers to validate pledge framing.\n- Micro Sprint: 60-minute hiring sprint with 5 employers at 1871 to test matching workflow and room flow.\n\nValidation Plan (4\u20136 Questions)\n- Which format best fits your late-summer schedule: rooftop night, pitch marketplace, or hiring sprints?\n- What would make you bring 2\u20133 colleagues? (food/music, exclusive access, curated intros, CE credits)\n- For employers: what commitment can you make onsite? (apprenticeship seats, interview day, mentorship hours)\n- Ticket comfort range ($75\u2013$125) and what perks matter most?\n- Must-have accessibility needs for you/your team?\n- Which sponsorship assets feel most valuable to your brand goals?\n\nDecision Timeline\n- Weeks 1\u20132: Stakeholder calls (board, top sponsors, employer champions), quick surveys to 2024 attendees.\n- Week 3: Select primary concept + reserve backup concept; approve budget.\n- Week 4: Kickoff\u2014lock venue holds, launch sponsor outreach, book production.\n\n90-Day Pre-Approval Tasks\n- Venue Holds: Secure two date options; confirm hybrid AV specs and ADA routes; weather contingency if rooftop.\n- Budget Model: Build three scenarios (base/optimistic/stretch) with ticket, sponsor, employer package ladders.\n- Sponsor Prospecting: 40-account list; tailored decks with named assets; confirm 2\u20133 early anchors.\n- Staffing/Volunteer Plan: RACI for Dev Dir, Events Mgr, Marketing, host committee; recruit 20 event-day volunteers.\n- Accessibility Plan: Contract CART/ASL; design quiet room; halal/veg vendors; pronoun-inclusive lanyards; inclusive signage.\n- Risk/Contingency: Weather backup, COVID/health guidance, tech redundancy for stream, no-show protocol.\n- Marketing Timeline: 12-week cadence\u2014save-the-date (T-12), sponsor reveal (T-10), speaker drip (T-8 onward), employer commitment teasers (T-6), price increase (T-4), final push (T-1).\n- Measurement: Define KPIs (new major prospects, employer pledges, interviews booked, net revenue); set up live dashboard.\n\nPrepared by Devin Patel, Director of Development for Executive Director + Board Development Committee on November 2, 2025",

4 = Good; 3 = Adequate; 2 = Weak; 1 = Poor\n\n---\n\n## 4) TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### #1: BUILD NIGHT LIVE (Concept 2)\n**Why This Concept:** Builds directly on 2024's successful Demo Night with proven format; showcases alumni talent to employers in real-time (addressing both major donor cultivation *and* employer visibility goals); theater setting allows 200+ in-person with strong hybrid capability; high sponsorship appeal for tech companies wanting to associate with innovation; tangible proof of program impact.\n\n**Key Risks:**  \n- Alumni performance anxiety or technical failures during demos  \n- Hybrid production quality disappoints virtual audience  \n- Sponsor judge recruitment takes longer than expected\n\n**Mitigations:**  \n- Run three rehearsal sessions with alumni; have backup video demos ready; assign tech mentors to each presenter  \n- Hire professional streaming team (budget $3K\u20135K); test run one week prior with full tech  \n- Start judge recruitment NOW through board connections; offer compelling brand visibility package\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Pilot a 60-min \"Mini Build Night\" for board + top 20 prospects in June 2025 at 1871 (3 demos, wine/cheese, $2K budget); gauge interest and refine format; use registration data to model ticket pricing.\n\n---\n\n### #2: BRIDGE BUILDER'S BRUNCH (Concept 5)\n**Why This Concept:** Intimate scale (50 decision-makers) perfectly matches \"50 new major donor prospects\" goal; lower staff intensity than large events; Sunday brunch timing differentiates from corporate calendar; structured roundtable drives employer partnerships beyond just donations; high net-per-attendee revenue; easiest to make fully accessible given small scale.\n\n**Key Risks:**  \n- 50 high-level attendees is ambitious recruitment target  \n- Conversation may feel forced or awkward without skilled facilitation  \n- Weather-dependent if considering outdoor venue\n\n**Mitigations:**  \n- Host committee of 8 each personally invites 6\u20137 people (gets you to 50); early-commit incentive pricing  \n- Hire professional facilitator experienced in corporate retreats ($1.5K\u20132K); provide table captains with discussion guides  \n- Book private dining room with indoor/outdoor flexibility; September weather generally reliable\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Test format as 20-person \"Founders Circle Breakfast\" in June with board members + their C-suite connections; charge $100, see if intimacy and structure resonate; iterate based on feedback.\n\n---\n\n### #3: CODE & CONVERSATION SERIES (Concept 1)\n**Why This Concept:** Scalable recurring model spreads revenue and cultivation across 6\u201312 months instead of one-night risk; low per-event cost (~$3K\u20135K) allows testing and iteration; August kickoff event serves as signature moment, then monthly touchpoints keep donors engaged; reuses successful Lunch & Learn model but adds evening social energy; sponsorship sold annually = easier pipeline.\n\n**Key Risks:**  \n- Attendance fatigue after 2\u20133 events  \n- Venue sourcing for monthly events strains host committee  \n- Revenue may not hit $40K net in year one\n\n**Mitigations:**  \n- Vary format monthly (e.g., Aug = rooftop kickoff, Sept = brewery, Oct = office tour); keep fresh  \n- Lock in 2\u20133 venue partners (1871, Industrious, local brewery) for rotating schedule; negotiate annual deals  \n- Combine series with one large signature event (e.g., Build Night Live in Sept) to hit revenue goals\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Launch single event in June 2025 as \"Summer Kickoff Happy Hour\" at 1871; invite 75 people, charge $50, see if alumni storytelling + networking formula works; if successful, announce fall series at the event.\n\n---\n\n## 5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\n### Potential Partners/Hosts\n\n**Venues:**\n- **1871** (tech hub, mission-aligned, may donate space for series or coworking day)  \n- **Venue SIX10 or Thalia Hall** (theater-style for Build Night Live, ADA-compliant, streaming capability)  \n- **Offshore Rooftop, Cerise, LH** (skyline views for Rooftop Remix or upscale receptions)  \n- **The Chopping Block, Kendall College** (Bytes & Bites cooking classes)  \n- **Museum of Science & Industry, Chicago History Museum** (after-hours prestige events)  \n- **Gibsons, RPM, Fulton Market Kitchen** (private dining for Bridge Builder's Brunch)\n\n**Community Orgs:**\n- **ChiTech Academy** (co-host tech events, provide volunteers, student spotlights)  \n- **ICIRR** (policy angle, immigrant rights storytelling, board connections)  \n- **City Colleges of Chicago** (recruit students, employer partnerships, venue space)  \n- **Local dev meetups** (Chicago JS, PyData, Technexus) \u2014 cross-promote, speaker recruitment\n\n**Media/In-Kind:**\n- **Built In Chicago, Crain's Chicago Business** (event coverage, sponsor packages)  \n- **Tock, Eventbrite** (donate ticketing platforms)  \n- **Televerde, Integrity Staffing** (sponsor + provide swag, event staff)  \n- **AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure** (in-kind tech for virtual events, sponsor tiers)\n\n---\n\n### Talent/MC Ideas\n\n1. **Emcee: Brandis Friedman** (WTTW Chicago Tonight anchor, civic-minded, recognizable to donor base)  \n2. **Keynote: Troy Carter** (former Spotify exec, Chicago roots, immigrant entrepreneurship advocate)  \n3. **Judge/Panelist: Harper Reed** (former CTO Obama campaign, Chicago tech icon, accessible speaker)  \n4. **Alumni Speaker: [Select 2024 Demo Night standout]** (authentic voice, peer appeal to young professionals)  \n5. **Fireside Chat: Kelly Robinson (CEO Talem Health) + Code Bridge Grad** (pair established leader with emerging talent)\n\n---\n\n### Sponsorship Hooks\n\n**Naming Tiers:**\n- **Presenting Partner:** $25K (logo on all materials, 10 VIP tickets, named program segment, job board access, year-round partnership recognition)  \n- **Impact Sponsor:** $15K (stage branding, 6 tickets, co-branded swag, apprenticeship partnership spotlight)  \n- **Community Champion:** $8K (program ad, 4 tickets, social media shoutout, booth/table at event)  \n- **Ally Sponsor:** $5K (logo inclusion, 2 tickets, newsletter feature)\n\n**Sponsored Segments:**\n- Welcome Reception Sponsor (open bar, branded napkins/signage)  \n- Alumni Showcase Sponsor (fund stipends for speakers/demo presenters)  \n- Accessibility Sponsor (fund ASL, CART, sliding-scale tickets\u2014strong CSR story)  \n- Virtual Experience Sponsor (streaming platform, branded digital swag for remote attendees)  \n- Matching Gift Sponsor (double donations during live giving moment)\n\n**Tangible Assets:**\n- Stage/backdrop branding, program book ads, swag bags (tote, notebook, stickers), digital ads in event app, booth space at in-person events, email blast to attendee list post-event, video testimonial featuring sponsor + alumni\n\n---\n\n### Beneficiary/Volunteer Involvement\n\n**Authentic Alumni Roles:**\n- **Storytellers:** 2\u20133 per event share 3\u20135 min career journey (not scripted sob stories\u2014emphasize agency and skills)  \n- **Demo Presenters:** Showcase capstone projects or current job work (Build Night, Bridge Talks)  \n- **Table Hosts:** Alumni seated at VIP tables guide conversation, answer employer questions  \n- **Advisory Input:** Survey alumni on event format preferences;

THE RESILIENT CITY SHOWCASE**\n- **Why This Concept:** This concept directly addresses the primary goal of securing major commitments by offering an immersive, tangible display of MCLF's impact and future projects. Its innovative format appeals to sophisticated HNWI and corporate leaders, setting it apart from typical Miami events while providing clear sponsorship opportunities and a strong platform for policy calls to action and site previews.\n- **Key Risks:** High production cost for interactive displays; potential for technical glitches with advanced A/V; difficulty in securing a truly differentiating \"wow factor\" venue.\n- **Mitigations:** Secure anchor corporate sponsors early for production costs; dedicated tech support team onsite and backup systems; meticulously vet and contract venue partners who share the vision for innovation.\n- **Quick Win Potential:** Pilot a smaller \"Discovery Zone\" or interactive display at an existing partner's event (e.g., Frost Science Museum) to test concepts and gauge audience engagement.\n\n**2. COASTAL CONVERSATIONS: INTIMATE DINNER SERIES**\n- **Why This Concept:** This strategy directly supports the primary goal by targeting HNWI and corporate leaders in a highly personalized, high-touch environment, fostering deeper relationships crucial for major gift cultivation. Its low operational capacity and cost drivers make it highly feasible given current staff resources, while offering exceptional net revenue potential through significant suggested contributions per dinner.\n- **Key Risks:** Dependency on host generosity for venues; limited capacity restricts reach; ensuring consistent, high-quality content across multiple unique events.\n- **Mitigations:** Recruit hosts from the Board and Patron network early; treat each dinner as a bespoke cultivation event, carefully pairing guests and topics; develop a core content brief for presenters, allowing for customization.\n- **Quick Win Potential:** Host one pilot dinner with Board members introducing a potential new major donor to a key project leader, testing the format and content engagement.\n\n**3. \"ECHOES OF TOMORROW\": A STORYTELLING GALA**\n- **Why This Concept:** This concept offers a fresh, emotionally resonant approach to the formal gala, making it distinct from competitors while still leveraging a proven high-revenue format. By featuring frontline neighborhood leaders and combining powerful narratives with artistic elements, it speaks powerfully to the audience's desire for impact and authentic connection, directly linking to all mission pillars.\n- **Key Risks:** Ensuring compelling, sensitive, and appropriately trained storytellers; potential for the event to feel disjointed without strong directorial vision; high production costs for artistic elements.\n- **Mitigations:** Engage professional storytelling coaches for community leaders; contract an experienced event producer with a strong narrative design background; seek in-kind sponsorship for artistic performances and A/V.\n- **Quick Win Potential:** Host a small \"storytelling salon\" for the Board and major prospect champions, featuring one or two community voices and a sneak peek of the artistic concept.\n\n---\n\n## 5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\n**Potential Partners/Hosts:**\n*   **Venues:** Frost Science Museum (for innovation/art exhibits), University of Miami (for summits/hackathons), private coastal venues (Deering Estate, Vizcaya), luxury waterfront hotels (e.g., The Mandarin Oriental Miami, Faena Hotel Miami Beach), prominent private residences for intimate gatherings.\n*   **Community Organizations:** University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science (research, expert speakers), Miami Herald (media partnership, storytelling), local neighborhood associations (for community leaders, authentic stories), Everglades Foundation (broader environmental advocacy, joint programming), local art galleries/museums.\n*   **Media Partners & In-Kind Sources:** Miami Herald, local lifestyle magazines, cultural institutions for cross-promotion; A/V production companies, caterers, florists, and graphic designers for in-kind services.\n\n**Talent/MC Ideas:**\n*   **Dr. Katharine Hayhoe:** Renowned climate scientist (remote/virtual keynote potential).\n*   **Ricky Arriola:** Miami Beach Commissioner, local leader with strong community ties.\n*   **Dr. Evelyn Gaiser:** Professor at FIU's Southeast Environmental Research Center, expert in Everglades/wetlands ecology.\n*   **Brenda Lee:** Respected local journalist from Miami Herald or WLRN, known for community reporting.\n*   **Lissette Calderon:** Real estate developer with strong local engagement and appreciation for resilient design.\n\n**Sponsorship Hooks:**\n*   **Naming Tiers:** \"Future of Miami Presenting Sponsor,\" \"Resilience Innovator Partner,\" \"Community Steward Patron,\" \"Biscayne Bay Champion.\"\n*   **Sponsored Segments:** \"Science & Solutions Hub\" (Showcase), \"Policy Dialogue Session\" (Summit), \"Community Voices Stage\" (Block Party/Gala), \"Keynote Address Sponsor,\" \"Accessibility Partner.\"\n*   **Tangible Assets:** Branded charging stations, eco-friendly delegate bags, branded shuttle services to remote sites, dedicated corporate tables at dinners, year-long recognition in MCLF communications.\n*   **Matching Gifts:** Corporate sponsors matching individual donations during a live appeal.\n\n**Beneficiary/Volunteer Involvement:**\n*   **Authentic Roles:** Frontline neighborhood leaders as speakers, panelists, or featured storytellers; scientists showcasing their research in interactive exhibits; young environmentalists presenting solutions at a hackathon. Consider a \"Youth Resilience Ambassador\" program.\n*   **Meaningful Volunteer Roles:** Volunteer Ambassador Corps members serve as event hosts, donor liaisons, accessibility navigators, and on-site support, engaging directly with attendees and sharing the mission. Opportunities for committee leadership roles within the volunteer corps.\n\n---\n\n## 6) NEXT STEPS & DECISION TIMELINE\n\n**Quick-Win Pilots:**\n*   **Coastal Conversations Micro-Test:** Host one intimate dinner (post-Board meeting) with 3-5 major donor prospects, featuring the CEO and a community leader, to test content and engagement.\n*   **Resilience Voices Digital Vignettes:** Create 2-3 short, professionally produced video testimonials/stories from frontline neighborhood leaders, shared digitally to assess audience resonance and build content for future events.\n\n**Validation Plan:**\n*   Engage Board and key Major Donors: Brief them on the top concepts, gather feedback on appeal and potential support.\n*   Consult Corporate Partners: Discuss sponsorship appetites and alignment with their ESG priorities.\n*   Audience Survey: Distribute a brief, bilingual online survey to a segment of the current donor/prospect list, asking about preferred event types and mission engagement.\n*   Expert Interviews: Conduct brief calls with event production specialists in Miami to assess feasibility and cost estimates for top concepts.\n*   Internal Staff Debrief: Review capacity implications with Events Director and Marketing on proposed concepts.\n\n**Decision Timeline:**\n*   **Week 1\u20132 (November):** Input Gathering & Internal Review (discussions with Board, key donors, staff).\n*   **Week 3 (November):** Concept Selection & Approval (CEO and Board Executive Committee approval).\n*   **Week 4 (December):** Kickoff & Initial Planning.\n\n**90-Day Pre-Approval Tasks (following concept selection):**\n1.  **Venue Holds:** Secure preliminary holds for preferred event dates and locations.\n2.  **Detailed Budget Model:** Develop comprehensive budget scenarios for the selected concept(s), including line-item expenses and projected revenue.\n3.  **Sponsor Prospecting List & Packages:** Identify top 50 corporate and individual prospects; develop tiered sponsorship decks.\n4.  **Staffing & Volunteer Plan:** Outline detailed roles and responsibilities for staff and Volunteer Ambassador Corps.\n5.  **Accessibility Plan:** Develop a comprehensive accessibility checklist and vendor requirements for the selected event.\n6.  **Risk & Contingency Plan:** Identify key event-specific risks and mitigation strategies (e.g., weather, speaker cancellations).\n7.  **Initial Marketing Timeline:** Draft a preliminary communications plan, including key message points and a launch calendar.",

          "Some capacity ratings questionable - 'Watershed Weekend' rated MEDIUM capacity but involves multi-day logistics, luxury accommodations, field site coordination, and expert management that likely exceeds stated staff availability",
          "Minor authenticity gaps - phrases like 'Aquinas Accelerator' (unclear naming rationale) and some concept descriptions occasionally feel more like consultant-speak than genuine event planning",
          "Limited hybrid detail - while hybrid options are flagged, the specific remote donor concierge experience mentioned in constraints isn't fully developed in most concepts"

WATERFRONT WISDOM: INTERGENERATIONAL RESILIENCE FORUM\n\n**Tagline/Theme:** Where elders' experience meets youth innovation\u2014planning for 100 years.\n\n**Mission Connection:** Forum pairs longtime Miami residents (who've witnessed environmental changes) with students, young professionals, and emerging leaders; storytelling and workshops co-create resilience solutions; emphasizes equity and intergenerational justice central to mission.\n\n**Audience Fit:** Appeals to older philanthropists as honored experts (not just funders); attracts younger corporate leaders seeking mentorship and purpose; demonstrates Foundation's equity commitment; builds cross-demographic coalition.\n\n**Experience:** Half-day forum: elder storytellers share environmental history; youth present innovative proposals; facilitated small-group workshops develop action plans; lunch networking; afternoon showcase with policymaker responses; closing reception with commitment opportunities for youth internships and project funding.\n\n**Venue/Season:** Community center or Rosenstiel School; late February 2026.\n\n**Accessibility/Inclusion:** Fully accessible venue; interpretation services; large-print materials; scholarship tickets ensure economic diversity; childcare provided; sliding scale $50\u2013$300 (youth free); virtual participation option.\n\n**Differentiation Hook:** Intergenerational model unprecedented in local environmental space; centers community wisdom versus expert-only panels; equity lens attracts impact investors and ESG funders.\n\n**Revenue Model:** Tickets $50\u2013$300 (sliding scale); corporate sponsors ($10K\u2013$40K) fund youth scholarships and internships; individual commitments for intern/fellowship endowment.\n\n**Cost Drivers:** Venue; interpretation; meals; childcare; elder/youth transportation assistance.\n\n**Capacity Intensity:** MEDIUM\u2014Requires community partnership for recruitment, but creates multi-year program pipeline; volunteer ambassadors facilitate workshops.\n\n---\n\n## 3) COMPARISON MATRIX\n\n| Concept # | Title | Mission Alignment | Net Revenue Potential | Audience Appeal | Differentiation | Feasibility/Capacity | TOTAL |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Rising Tide Summit & Celebration | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | **22** |\n| 2 | Blue Moon Mangrove Gala | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | **22** |\n| 3 | Resilience Accelerator Challenge | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | **22** |\n| 4 | Coastal Cocktails & Conversations | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | **24** |\n| 5 | Tides of Change Livestream | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **19** |\n| 6 | Blue Carbon Breakfast Series | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | **21** |\n| 7 | Mangrove Mile Twilight Walk | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | **18** |\n| 8 | Resilient Reefs & Real Estate Symposium | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | **23** |\n| 9 | Floating Fundraiser: Sunset Cruise | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | **22** |\n| 10 | Resilience Exchange Progressive Dinner | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 2 | **20** |\n| 11 | Virtual Town Hall: State of Shores | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 5 | **17** |\n| 12 | Wetlands Circle Legacy Retreat | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | **23** |\n| 13 | Science on Tap: Coastal Conversations | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 5 | **18** |\n| 14 | High Tide Challenge Virtual Competition | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | **17** |\n| 15 | Waterfront Wisdom Intergenerational Forum | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | **21** |\n\n**Key:** 5 = Excellent; 4 = Good; 3 = Adequate; 2 = Weak; 1 = Poor\n\n---\n\n## 4) TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### **RECOMMENDATION #1: Coastal Cocktails & Conversations (Concept 4)**\n\n**Why This Concept:** This salon series achieves the $500K commitment goal through intimate, high-touch cultivation of major donors at approximately 10% of total budget ($25\u201330K for entire series). The distributed format leverages volunteer ambassador corps as hosts, minimizes staff capacity strain, and creates multiple entry points for relationship-building. By featuring frontline neighborhood leaders and Biscayne site previews in private settings, the model delivers mission authenticity while respecting donor preference for meaningful, exclusive engagement. The series model allows testing and iteration, with successful formats replicated.\n\n**Key Risks:** (1) Host recruitment may fall short, reducing reach. (2) Decentralized format creates quality control challenges across multiple events. (3) Intimacy limits total attendee numbers, potentially constraining overall revenue ceiling.\n\n**Mitigations:** (1) Board Executive Committee pre-commits to hosting 3\u20134 salons before broader ambassador recruitment; create host recognition tier to incentivize participation. (2) Develop standardized presentation deck, speaker training, and host playbook; events director attends each salon to ensure consistency. (3) Pair salon series with one larger signature event (Recommendation #2) to capture broader donor base while salons focus on major gift closures.\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Pilot with single board-hosted event in December 2025 (pre-campaign); test VR technology, speaker impact, and ask methodology. Refine based on feedback before launching full January\u2013February series. Low cost allows risk-tolerant experimentation.\n\n---\n\n### **RECOMMENDATION #2: Rising Tide Summit & Celebration (Concept 1)**\n\n**Why This Concept:** This dual-format event directly addresses the real estate and corporate sustainability audience with thought leadership they value while delivering the prestige and social experience expected by HNWI philanthropists. The morning Summit positions the Foundation as authoritative convener on resilience policy\u2014critical for corporate ESG partnerships\u2014while evening Celebration provides cultivation and commitment opportunities. The format accommodates 450\u2013550 attendees, supports robust sponsorship packages ($250K target feasible across 10\u201312 corporate partners), and naturally integrates accessibility, bilingual programming, and hybrid elements. The structure allows sponsors to engage in Summit (professional value) and Celebration (social prestige), maximizing partnership appeal.\n\n**Key Risks:** (1) Dual-venue logistics strain lean staff capacity. (2) Weather or transit issues between locations disrupt experience. (3) Summit content may not engage all attendees, creating attendance drop-off before evening.\n\n**Mitigations:** (1) Partner with Rosenstiel School for morning venue management and content development, reducing Foundation staff burden; hire day-of event coordinator (within budget). (2) Select venues within 15-minute shuttle ride; negotiate backup indoor evening space; communicate contingency plans proactively. (3) Design Summit with tiered registration\u2014full-day attendees receive priority seating/perks at evening event; market morning to corporate teams, evening to individual philanthropists, acknowledging audience segments.\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Host single Summit-style breakfast briefing in November 2025 with corporate partners to test content format, gauge interest, and secure early sponsor commitments. Use attendee feedback to refine full-day agenda.\n\n---\n\n### **RECOMMENDATION #3: Wetlands Circle Legacy Giving Retreat (Concept 12)**\n\n**Why This Concept:** This high-touch stewardship event targets transformational gifts ($100K+ multi-year commitments, planned gifts) from the Foundation's top 40\u201350 donors, offering exceptional ROI relative to capacity investment. The intimate format aligns with low-to-medium risk tolerance\u2014fewer attendees mean manageable logistics\u2014while the estate planning content provides tangible value that positions asks as collaborative wealth planning rather than transactional requests. The Biscayne Bay site visit and exclusive access create prestige, and the retreat model naturally accommodates accessibility needs (boat accommodations, accessible estate venue). By focusing on legacy commitments, the event seeds long-term revenue streams beyond the immediate $500K goal.\n\n**Key Risks:** (1) Limited invitation list may exclude donors on cusp of major giving capacity who could be inspired by participation. (2) Estate planning content may not resonate with younger segment of 35\u201350 demographic. (3) Weather-dependent boat component introduces logistical uncertainty.\n\n**Mitigations:** (1) Establish clear invitation criteria (lifetime giving $25K+) while reserving 10\u201315 spots for \"emerging visionaries\" (younger, high-capacity prospects); creates aspiration and pipeline. (2) Offer diverse breakout options\u2014estate planning for older attendees, impact investing structures for younger corporate leaders\u2014recognizing life-stage differences. (3) Schedule backup rain-date; alternatively, plan covered boat option or replace boat with land-based immersive experience (VR Bay tour, mangrove nursery visit).\n\n**Quick Win Potential:** Convene mini \"legacy circle\" lunch with 8\u201310 top donors in December 2025 to preview retreat concept, gather input on content preferences, and secure early commitments. Use gathering to recruit retreat planning committee from attendees.\n\n---\n\n## 5) IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT\n\n### **Potential Partners/Hosts**\n\n**Venues:**\n- **Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science** (Summit, Symposium, Retreat): academic credibility, built-in AV, waterfront access\n- **P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami** (Challenge, Gala): iconic waterfront architecture, accessible infrastructure, prestige brand\n- **Frost Science Museum** (Challenge, Town Hall): mission alignment, broadcast capabilities, family-friendly accessibility\n- **Vizcaya Museum & Gardens** (Retreat, Progressive Dinner stop): historic elegance, accessible grounds, donor appeal\n- **Crandon Park/Matheson Hammock** (Gala, Walk): coastal setting, public accessibility, affordable permits\n- **Private estates** (Salons, Retreat): Coral Gables, Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne waterfront properties via board connections\n\n**Community Organizations:**\n- **Miami Herald** (media partnership): event promotion, livestream co-broadcasting, editorial content collaboration\n- **Everglades Foundation** (co-host Symposium or Summit): shared resilience mission, corporate sponsor overlap, credibility\n- **Little Haiti Cultural Complex, Lotus House, Miami Homes for All** (neighborhood partner organizations): frontline leader recruitment, progressive dinner sites, equity lens advisors\n- **University of Miami Office of Civic & Community Engagement** (Challenge, Forum): student/faculty volunteers, research partnerships, academic credibility\n- **Miami-Dade County Parks & Recreation** (Walk, planting events): permitting support, venue access, community outreach\n\n**In-Kind Sources:**\n- **Local restaurants** (Zuma, Mandolin, Rosetta Bakery): donated catering for salons in exchange for recognition\n- **Knight Foundation, Irie Foundation**: potential underwriting for accessibility accommodations or livestream production\n- **Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean**: boat charters or maritime logistics support (ESG alignment)\n- **FPL, Lennar, Related Group**: corporate venue space, printing, technology donations\n\n---\n\n### **Talent/MC Ideas**\n\n1. **Daniella Levine Cava**, Miami-Dade County Mayor: keynote for Summit or Symposium;

          "Capacity intensity ratings occasionally underestimate complexity\u2014the Progressive Dinner (Concept 10) is rated 'HIGH' but the Floating Fundraiser (Concept 9) only 'MEDIUM' despite similar multi-site/vessel logistics challenges",
          "Some concepts may exceed stated staff capacity\u2014several 'MEDIUM-HIGH' intensity events within a 16-week timeline with lean staffing (VP 10 hrs/wk, Director 25 hrs/wk) could create burnout risk not fully acknowledged",
          "Minor redundancy\u2014Concepts 5 (Livestream) and 11 (Town Hall) are quite similar in format and could have been consolidated to make room for another distinct concept type",
          "Sponsorship math not fully detailed\u2014the $250K sponsorship goal across concepts isn't mapped to specific tier quantities (e.g., '2 @ $100K + 4 @ $25K + 6 @ $15K = $250K') which would strengthen feasibility assessment"
