While motivated to contribute positively to their community and understand food systems, concrete opportunities for hands-on experience and structured learning were limited, creating a barrier to meaningful engagement.\n\n**The Intervention**\nThe Roots & Routes Youth Garden Apprenticeship provided Jay with a 12-week paid opportunity to develop critical skills in sustainable gardening and food justice. Meeting weekly for three hours, participants received a $15/hour stipend, mentorship from experienced gardeners, and engaged in workshops on food justice. This rigorous program annually supports 25 youth, fostering practical environmental stewardship and addressing community food security.\n\n**After: The Outcome**\nJay's engagement with the program yielded significant outcomes. They achieved 100% attendance, participating in all 12 weekly sessions of the apprenticeship. Pre- and post-program assessments indicated Jay\u2019s knowledge of sustainable gardening practices increased by an average of 40%. Furthermore, Jay actively contributed to community outreach, completing 3 events that successfully shared vital food\njustice information with over 75 local residents.\n\n**Direct Quote(s)**\n\u201cBefore Roots & Routes, I thought gardening was just planting seeds. Now I see it as a way to connect with my community and understand where my food actually comes from. It also showed me that I can really make a difference.\u201d\n\n**Call to Action**\nContinued investment in programs like Roots & Routes is crucial for empowering the next generation of community leaders and fostering sustainable food systems.

Renee joined a cohort of [24] renters working toward housing stability; last year, Stability First served [XXX] Chicago households facing eviction.\n\n5) After: The Outcome (80\u2013100 words)\nWithin [60] days, Renee completed [number] coaching sessions and filed all documents on time. She advocated for needed repairs and negotiated a mediated payment plan that reduced arrears by [$ amount] through a one-time grant and spread the balance over [months]. Renee increased income by [X%] by adding [additional shifts/new hours], created a spending plan, and set up automatic payments. She has retained housing for [9] months with [95%] on-time rent since coaching, and built a [two]-month emergency fund\u2014steps she identified and led to safeguard her long-term stability.\n\n6) Direct Quote(s) (2\u20134 sentences each)\nN/A\n\n7) Call to Action (1\u20132 sentences)\nN/A.

If yes, please share; if not, should we schedule a quote check?\n3) Who are the delivery partners (legal aid/mediation) we can name publicly, if any? If anonymity is preferred, confirm.\n4) Confirm audience and channel (Donors/Funders/Community/Clients; Newsletter/Website/Grant/Social) and share the desired CTA and link.\n5) Program details to include: typical duration and meeting frequency, any supports offered (transit, childcare, fee coverage), and last year\u2019s households served.",
