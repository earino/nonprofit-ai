Ten solar-powered community fridges will offer fresh produce and staples across Englewood, Bronzeville, and Woodlawn. Low-income families, seniors, and transit-limited residents on the South Side will benefit. Reliable access to fresh food is scarce and expensive in several South Side neighborhoods, forcing long trips and skipped meals. This network is expected to serve 7,500 people monthly in its first year, providing essential food resources. An interactive map of fridge locations is available at bridgeviewtable.org/fridges.\n\nMany South Side blocks are over two miles from a full-service grocery store. Cook County\u2019s food insecurity rate was 13.5% in 2022. The Southside Fresh Fridge Network will install and stock 15 solar-powered fridges with fresh produce, dairy, and other essential items, monitored daily by local volunteers. The program also features weekly nutrition pop-ups offering simple, low-cost recipes using culturally familiar ingredients. Additionally, Bridgeview Community Table coordinates bulk purchasing with small corner stores to reduce prices on fresh items by up to 20%.\n\nThe initiative provides stipends and safety training for resident \u201cFridge Stewards\u201d at each site, empowering community members. A transparent dashboard will track inventory, uptime, and usage by ZIP code. Key partners include the Greater Chicago Food Depository, St. Bernard Hospital, the Chicago Park District, and Bronzeville Community Garden.\n\nMarisol Vega, Executive Director of Bridgeview Community Table, emphasized the program's community-driven nature. \u201cThis is neighbor-powered dignity. It means people can skip a long bus trip for groceries and find fresh food right on their block,\u201d Vega said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a Fridge Steward restock oranges and milk just before school lets out, knowing kids will grab healthy snacks on their way home.\u201d\n\nDr. Aaron Whitaker, Community Health Director at St. Bernard Hospital, highlighted the direct health benefits. \u201cAccess to nutritious food is fundamental to well-being. This network helps build a healthier community, one fridge at a time.\u201d\n\n**MEDIA INVITATION**\n\nMedia are invited to a kickoff and site visit at 9 a.m. on June 10 at the Kennedy-King College parking lot. Please contact press@bridgeviewtable.org to request interviews, a ride-along with Fridge Stewards, or a media kit.\n\n**Assets:**\nHigh-resolution photos: https://bit.ly/southsidefridge-photos\nB-roll footage: https://bit.ly/southsidefridge-broll\nWebsite: https://bridgeviewtable.org\n\n**Email Subject Lines & Pitches:**\n\n**Block Club Chicago:** South Side Community Fridges Launch for Food Access\n**Pitch:** Bridgeview Community Table launches a solar-powered fridge network across the South Side, bringing fresh food directly to neighborhoods.
