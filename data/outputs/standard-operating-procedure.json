This guide is for the Volunteer Coordinator, and it\u2019s also a helpful resource for anyone covering this role, like the Program Assistant.\n\n### 2) Scope and Timing\n\nThis procedure is typically triggered when a prospective volunteer submits an inquiry or application. It is performed as needed, usually within 3-5 business days of an initial volunteer inquiry. The entire onboarding process, including background checks, aims to be completed within 10-14 days, depending on response times from the volunteer and Sterling Volunteers.\n\n### 3) Roles and Coverage\n\n*   **Primary:** Volunteer Coordinator \u2013 Requires access to Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Sheets), Jotform, Sterling Volunteers, and Slack.\n*   **Backup:** Program Assistant \u2013 Requires the same access as the Volunteer Coordinator.\n\n### 4) Tools and Systems\n\n*   **Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Sheets):** Used for communication, storing volunteer documents, and managing the volunteer roster.\n    *   **Access:** Log in at mail.google.com with your @sagebrushfoodshelf.org email address.\n*   **Jotform:** Our primary tool for volunteer applications.\n    *   **Access:** Log in at jotform.com with the organization's account credentials.\n*   **Sterling Volunteers:** Our dedicated platform for conducting background checks.\n    *   **Access:** Log in at app.sterlingvolunteers.com with your organizational account.\n    *   **Low-Cost Alternative (if Sterling is down):** For urgent needs or temporary issues, you may use a free online background check service for initial screening (e.g., public records search) and note this in the volunteer\u2019s record.

The orientation is a chance to explain our mission, volunteer roles, and answer questions.\n    *   **Decision Point:** If the applicant\u2019s availability or interests don\u2019t match current needs, kindly suggest other ways they can support or refer them to partner organizations if appropriate.\n\n4.  **Conduct Orientation/Interview & Initiate Background Check (30-45 minutes):**\n    *   **Who:** Volunteer Coordinator (or Program Assistant)\n    *   **What:** During the orientation, explain the mandatory background check process and answer any questions.\n    *   **Action:** Immediately after the orientation (or during, if convenient), initiate the background check through Sterling Volunteers.\n        *   **Where:** Log into app.sterlingvolunteers.com.\n        *   **Action:** Click \"Invite New Volunteer.\"\n        *   **Screen:** Complete the **Sterling Volunteers Invitation Screen** (placeholder for screenshot, includes name, email, volunteer type).\n        *   **Action:** Ensure the correct Sagebrush Community Food Shelf package is selected.\n        *   **Action:** Confirm the volunteer understands and consents.\n\n5.  **Monitor Background Check Status (Daily, 5 minutes):**\n    *   **Who:** Volunteer Coordinator (or Program Assistant)\n    *   **What:** Check Sterling Volunteers daily for updates on pending background checks.\n    *   **Action:** Follow up with volunteers via email or phone if their background check remains pending for more than 3 business days.\n\n6.  **Review Background Check Results (10-15 minutes):**\n    *   **Who:** Volunteer Coordinator (or Program Assistant)\n    *   **What:** Once Sterling Volunteers reports results, carefully review them.\n    *   **Action:** Adhere to **State of Wyoming volunteer screening guidelines** when interpreting results.\n    *   **Decision Point:** If the background check raises concerns, **do NOT make an immediate decision.** Consult Section 7 (Troubleshooting) and Section 10 (Related Procedures and Escalation).\n\n7.  **Add Approved Volunteer to Roster (5-10 minutes):**\n    *   **Who:** Volunteer Coordinator (or Program Assistant)\n    *   **What:** For approved volunteers, update our Google Sheet: Volunteer Roster.\n    *   **Where:** Google Drive > Volunteers > Volunteer Roster.\n    *   **Screen:** Populate the **Google Sheet: Volunteer Roster** (placeholder for screenshot, includes columns for Name, Contact Info, Start Date, Background Check Status/Date, Volunteer Interest).\n    *   **Action:** Enter all relevant contact information, availability, and preferred volunteer roles.\n\n8.  **Send Welcome & Onboarding Materials (10-15 minutes):**\n    *   **Who:** Volunteer Coordinator (or Program Assistant)\n    *   **What:** Send a cheerful welcome email.\n    *   **Action:** Include links to our Volunteer Handbook (stored in Google Drive), schedule coordination details, and any immediate training resources.\n    *   **Action:** Briefly explain our **PII handling best practices** for volunteers (e.g., not sharing client names, logging out of systems).\n\n9.  **Schedule First Shift (5-10 minutes):**\n    *   **Who:** Volunteer Coordinator (or Program Assistant)\n    *   **What:** Work with the new volunteer to schedule their first shift.\n    *   **Action:** Confirm via email and add to the shared volunteer calendar (Google Calendar).\n\n**Mini-Checklist:**\n*   \u2713 Initial acknowledgment sent?\n*   \u2713 Jotform application reviewed?\n*   \u2713 Orientation scheduled/completed?\n*   \u2713 Sterling Background Check initiated?\n*   \u2713 Background Check results reviewed against Wyoming guidelines?\n*   \u2713 Volunteer Roster updated?\n*   \u2713 Welcome email with handbook sent?\n*   \u2713 First shift scheduled?\n\n### 6) Definition of Done / Quality Standards\n\n*   \u2713 Volunteer\u2019s Jotform application is marked as \"Processed\" or \"Complete.\"\n*   \u2713 Sterling Volunteers reflects a \"Clear\" or \"Approved\" status for the background check.\n*   \u2713 Volunteer\u2019s record in the Google Sheet: Volunteer Roster is fully populated, including background check clearance date.\n*   \u2713 Welcome email sent with links to all necessary onboarding documents.\n*   \u2713 First shift scheduled and confirmed with the new volunteer.\n\n### 7) Troubleshooting\n\n*   **If a volunteer doesn\u2019t respond to initial outreach:** Send one follow-up email after 3 business days, then close the inquiry after 7 days if no response. Note in a \"Declined/Unresponsive\" tab of the volunteer inquiry sheet.\n*   **If a volunteer background check returns a \"Review\" status:**\n    *   **Then:** Do NOT automatically disqualify. Refer to the **State of Wyoming volunteer screening guidelines** document (Google Drive > Operations > Policy) for specific criteria. If still unclear, escalate to Marcus Hale (Executive Director) via Slack or email for review and guidance. Follow a fair and consistent adverse action process as outlined in our HR policies.\n*   **If a volunteer requests an alternative to Jotform/digital documents:**\n    *   **Then:** Offer a printable PDF version of the application and direct them to mail it in or drop off at the office. For data entry, the Volunteer Coordinator will manually enter the data into the digital systems.\n\n### 8) Data, Privacy, and Accessibility\n\n*   **PII Handling:** All volunteer personal identifiable information (PII) collected (e.g., contact info, background check results) must be stored securely in Google Drive folders with restricted access. Do not share PII outside of Sagebrush Community Food Shelf staff directly involved in volunteer management. Regularly review and purge outdated PII following our data retention policy (Google Drive > Operations > Policy). Adhere to **PII handling best practices**, including using strong passwords and never sharing login credentials.\n*   **State of Wyoming volunteer screening guidelines:** Our background check policies and interpretation of results are strictly aligned with these guidelines to ensure consistency and fairness. A copy is available in Google Drive > Operations > Policy.\n*   **Accessibility:** Our Jotform application is designed to be user-friendly. For individuals with visual or other impairments, we offer phone assistance or a physical application form. Background check procedures are handled directly by Sterling Volunteers, who are responsible for their accessibility. We have no specific HIPAA or FERPA regulations that apply to our volunteer screening process.\n\n### 9) Communication Templates/Snippets\n\n**Initial Inquiry Acknowledgment Email:**\n\n**Subject:** Welcome to Sagebrush Community Food Shelf - Next Steps to Volunteer!\n\nHi [Volunteer Name],\n\nThank you for your interest in volunteering with Sagebrush Community Food Shelf!

      "content": "Here\u2019s the SOP for Student Enrollment and Consent Management at Harbor City Arts Lab, crafted with a casual tone for easy understanding and use by your small team.\n\n---\n\n**Harbor City Arts Lab**\n**Standard Operating Procedure: Student Enrollment and Consent Management**\n\n---\n\n### **1) Purpose and Audience**\n\nHey team! This SOP is here to make sure we enroll all our amazing youth program participants smoothly and, more importantly, get all the necessary consent forms handled correctly. It\u2019s for anyone who helps with enrollment \u2013 think our Program Manager, Youth Programs, and even our awesome Lead Teaching Artist when they\u2019re covering.\n\n### **2) Scope and Timing**\n\nThis process kicks in whenever a new student wants to join a program or an existing student needs to re-enroll for a new session. It\u2019s usually a rolling thing, happening as applications come in, but definitely spikes before new program sessions start. Budget about 15-20 minutes per student, unless there are special circumstances.\n\n### **3) Roles and Coverage**\n\n*   **Program Manager, Youth Programs (Primary):** You're the go-to for this! You'll need access to Airtable (specifically the 'Students' Base), Jotform, DocuSign, and our full Google Workspace (Drive, Gmail, Slack).\n*   **Lead Teaching Artist (Backup):** When the Program Manager is out, you've got this! Same access permissions needed as the Program Manager. Just make sure you\u2019re updated on any current enrollments.\n\n### **4) Tools and Systems**\n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of what you\u2019ll be using and how to get in:\n\n*   **Airtable:** Our main database for student info.\n    *   *Access:* Log in at [airtable.com/login](https://airtable.com/login). Make sure you\u2019re in the \"Harbor City Arts Lab\" workspace and have access to the 'Students' base.\n*   **Jotform:** Where families fill out initial applications.\n    *   *Access:* Log in at [jotform.com/login](https://www.jotform.com/login). You should have access to the \"Youth Program Application\" form.\n*   **DocuSign:** For getting those digital signatures on consent forms.\n    *   *Access:* Log in at [docusign.com](https://www.docusign.com/). Ensure you have sender permissions for our consent form templates.\n*   **Google Workspace (Drive, Gmail):** For storing documents, communicating, and general work stuff.\n    *   *Access:* Log in at [mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com/) with your `@harborcityartslab.org` email. All documents will live in Drive.\n*   **Slack:** Our quick communication channel.\n    *   *Access:* Open the Slack desktop app or log in at [slack.com/signin](https://slack.com/signin/). You\u2019ll be in the \"Harbor City Arts Lab\" workspace.\n\n*Low-cost alternative if a tool is down:* If Jotform is acting up, we can use a Google Form template (find it in Google Drive > Templates > Enrollment Forms) and then manually input data into Airtable later. Same goes for DocuSign \u2013 print the PDF, get a wet signature, then scan and upload it. Not ideal, but it works!\n\n### **5) Step-by-Step Instructions**\n\nLet's get those kiddos enrolled!\n\n1.  **Check for New Applications (Daily, 5 min):** First thing, check Jotform for new \"Youth Program Application\" submissions. You\u2019ll usually get an email notification, but it's good to double-check the Jotform \"Submissions\" tab.\n2.  **Review Application & Contact Info (5 min):** Open the new submission. Quickly skim to make sure it's complete and all required fields are filled. Pay close attention to parent/guardian contact details.\n3.  **Create/Update Student Record in Airtable (10 min):**\n    *   Go to Airtable and open the 'Students' Base.\n    *   Navigate to the **Airtable 'Students' Base \u2014 Enrollment Form View** (this view is set up to match the Jotform fields).\n    *   If it's a new student, click \"Add a record\" and start filling in the details from the Jotform submission (Student Name, DOB, Parent/Guardian Name, Email, Phone, Emergency Contact, Program Requested).\n    *   If they're a returning student, find their existing record and update any new info, especially for the \"Program Requested\" field.\n    *   Make sure to tick the \"Application Received\" checkbox.\n4.  **Initiate Consent Forms via DocuSign (10 min):**\n    *   After the Airtable record is created/updated, head over to DocuSign.\n    *   Locate the \"Youth Program Enrollment & Consent Packet\" template.\n    *   Access the **DocuSign Template Settings placeholder** for this template.\n    *   Start a new envelope using the template.\n    *   Enter the parent/guardian's name and email address from the Airtable record as the primary signatory.\n    *   Double-check that the \"Image Release Consent\" checkbox and \"Medical Information\" fields are included and ready for signature.\n    *   Send it off!\n5.  **Update Airtable with Consent Status (2 min):** Back in the student\u2019s Airtable record, update the \"Consent Forms Sent\" checkbox and add the date the DocuSign was sent.\n6.  **Follow-up for Unsigned Forms (Weekly, 5 min):** If forms haven\u2019t been signed after 3-5 business days (DocuSign will also send reminders), send a friendly follow-up email from your `@harborcityartslab.org` Gmail account to the parent/guardian. (See Section 9 for a template.)\n7.  **DocuSign Completion Notification (Daily, 2 min):** DocuSign will send an email once the forms are complete. Open the email and confirm all fields are signed.\n8.  **Download & Upload Signed Forms (5 min):**\n    *   From DocuSign, download the fully executed consent packet as a PDF.\n    *   Upload this PDF to the student's dedicated folder in Google Drive (Google Drive > Programs > [Program Name] > Students > [Student Name] > Consent Forms).\n9.  **Final Airtable Update (3 min):** In the student's Airtable record:\n    *   Tick the \"Consent Forms Received\" checkbox.\n    *   Add the date received.\n    *   Attach the link to the uploaded PDF in Google Drive to the \"Consent Forms Link\" field.\n    *   Mark \"Enrollment Complete\" as checked.\n10. **Slack Notification (1 min):** Send a quick message to the relevant program channel (e.g., #youth-programs) on Slack: \"New student enrolled: [Student Name] for [Program Name]. Consent forms complete!\"\n11. **Welcome Email (3 min):** Send a cheerful welcome email to the parent/guardian from your `@harborcityartslab.org` Gmail with program start dates, expectations, and any immediate next steps. (See Section 9 for a template.)\n\n**Mini-Checklist for Enrollment Complete:**\n*   Airtable record created/updated?\n*   Consent forms sent via DocuSign?\n*   Signed forms downloaded & uploaded to Drive?\n*   Airtable \"Enrollment Complete\" checked?\n*   Welcome email sent?\n\n### **6) Definition of Done / Quality Standards**\n\nA student's enrollment is officially DONE when all of these are true:\n\n*   \u2713 Student has a complete record in Airtable with all application data.\n*   \u2713 All required consent forms (including image release) are signed via DocuSign.\n*   \u2713 A copy of the signed consent packet is stored in the student\u2019s Google Drive folder.\n*   \u2713 The \"Enrollment Complete\" checkbox in Airtable is marked for that student.\n*   \u2713 A welcome email has been sent to the parent/guardian.\n\n### **7) Troubleshooting**\n\nHere are some common hiccups and how to fix 'em:\n\n*   **If parent/guardian can't access DocuSign:**\n    *   **Then** double-check the email address in Airtable. If correct, resend the DocuSign envelope. If still an issue, offer to print the form for a wet signature (scan and upload later).\n*   **If a student is under 13 years old (COPPA):**\n    *   **Then** ensure both parental consent and image release are explicitly obtained. Our DocuSign template is set up for this, but just be extra mindful.\n*   **If a parent explicitly declines image release:**\n    *   **Then** note this clearly in the student's Airtable record and communicate it to the Lead Teaching Artist and relevant program staff via Slack immediately. Mark the student\u2019s record with a clear tag like \"NO_IMAGE_RELEASE.\"\n*   **If the application in Jotform is incomplete:**\n    *   **Then** reach out to the parent/guardian via email or phone for missing info before proceeding. Don't process incomplete applications.\n*   **If a student's PII seems compromised or incorrect:**\n    *   **Then** immediately flag their record in Airtable and stop processing. Inform the Director of Programs (Robert Chen) via Slack and email for next steps.\n\n### **8) Data, Privacy, and Accessibility**\n\n*   **PII & Data Handling:** We're dealing with sensitive info here! All personally identifiable information (PII) like names, birthdates, and medical info is kept confidential. It's stored securely in Airtable and Google Drive, which both have robust security.\n    *   *FERPA* (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) principles guide us in protecting student education records. Basically, keep it private unless authorized.\n    *   *COPPA* (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) applies to our students under 13. This means we *must* get parental consent to collect any PII from them. Our DocuSign template covers this.\n    *   *Image Release Consent:* Always confirm we have permission before using any student photos or videos. If not received, we absolutely abstain from using their image.\n    *   *Basic PII Retention Policy:* We'll keep student enrollment records (including applications and consent forms) for 7 years after their last program participation, then securely archive or delete them as per our internal data retention schedule.\n*   **Language Access:** Our Jotform application currently has English and Spanish versions available. Always provide the application in the family\u2019s preferred language if we have it! We can also leverage Google Translate for quick email responses if needed, but for formal communications, we aim for provided translations.\n*   **Accessibility:** Our public-facing enrollment materials (like the Jotform link) should always be digital and compatible with screen readers. If a family needs an alternative format, we'll do our best to provide one (e.g., printed copies in large print).\n\n### **9) Communication Templates/Snippets**\n\n**A) Follow-up for Unsigned DocuSign:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Harbor City Arts Lab: Gentle Reminder for Enrollment Forms for [Student Name]\n*   **Body:**\n    Hi [Parent/Guardian Name],\n\n    Just a friendly follow-up regarding the enrollment and consent forms for [Student Name]\u2019s program at Harbor City Arts Lab. We sent these via DocuSign a few days ago.\n\n    To finalize their spot, we just need those forms signed! You should have an email from DocuSign ([noreply@docusign.net]) with a link.\n\n    If you're having trouble accessing them or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this email or call us at [Harbor City Arts Lab Phone Number].\n\n    Thanks so much,\n    The Team at Harbor City Arts Lab\n\n**B) Welcome Email to New Families:**\n\n*   **Subject:** Welcome to the Harbor City Arts Lab family, [Student Name]!\n*   **Body:**\n    Hey [Parent/Guardian Name],\n\n    Amazing news!

Student can still participate. |\n| **Student is under 13 and parent email bounces** | Use phone number to reach parent; offer to email alternate address or print/mail consent forms. Do NOT start student until signed consent received. |\n| **Jotform submission is duplicate (same student, same session)** | Check Airtable first; if record exists, reply to parent: \"We have [Student Name] enrolled\u2014see you [Session Start Date]!\" Do not create duplicate record. |\n| **Parent requests accommodation (e.g., ASL interpreter, dietary)** | Note in Airtable \"Accommodations\" field; tag @robert.chen in Slack immediately to arrange support before first session. |\n\n---\n\n### 8) Data, Privacy, and Accessibility\n\n**FERPA:** Student records in Airtable and Drive are educational records\u2014share only with staff who need access to deliver programs. Do not post student last names or DOB publicly.\n\n**COPPA (under 13):** Always send consent requests to parent/guardian email, never directly to student email if under 13. Check DOB before sending.\n\n**Image release consent:** Stored in DocuSign packet; if parent opts out, flag in Airtable and brief teaching artists. No photos/video of that student for social media or promotional use (classroom documentation OK if faces not identifiable).\n\n**PII retention:** Keep student records for 3 years post-participation (IRS and grant reporting), then archive or delete per annual data cleanup SOP.\n\n**Language access:** Spanish-language enrollment form available in Jotform; consent packet has Spanish version\u2014send both if parent indicates Spanish preference in form.\n\n**ADA:** If parent requests alternate format (large print, screen-reader friendly), email consent text as plain-text .docx and accept scanned signature via email in lieu of DocuSign.\n\n---\n\n### 9) Communication Templates/Snippets\n\n**Template 1: Missing Info Follow-Up (Jotform)**\n\n> **Subject:** Quick question about [Student First Name]'s enrollment \u2013 Harbor City Arts Lab\n> \n> Hi [Parent Name],\n> \n> Thanks for signing [Student First Name] up for [Session Name]!

This document ensures compliance with IRS regulations, donor stewardship best practices, and organizational consistency, particularly for new staff, temporary coverage, and cross-training purposes.\n\n**2) Scope and Timing**\nThis procedure is triggered at the close of each calendar month for all recurring donations processed within that month. The process is performed monthly, typically within the first five (5) business days of the subsequent month. The expected duration for this task is approximately 2-4 hours, depending on the volume of monthly donors.\n\n**3) Roles and Coverage**\nThe primary responsibility for executing this SOP rests with the **Donor Relations Manager**. In the absence of the primary role, the **Development Operations Analyst** will act as coverage. Both roles require full administrative access to Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT, editing permissions for relevant SharePoint folders, and full access to Microsoft 365 applications (Outlook, Word, DocuSign).\n\n**4) Tools and Systems**\n\n*   **Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT:** Donor database and gift management.\n    *   Access: Log in at [https://app.blackbaud.com/](https://app.blackbaud.com/) using organizational credentials.\n    *   Low-cost alternative (if primary system down): Utilize the \"Backup Donor Data (Monthly Recurring)\" Excel file located in SharePoint > Development > Donor Data > Backups, and process acknowledgments manually using the Word template. Update Raiser's Edge NXT upon system restoration.\n*   **Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Word):** Email communication and document generation.\n    *   Access: Log in at [https://www.office.com/](https://www.office.com/) with organizational credentials.\n*   **SharePoint:** Document storage, SOPs, and acknowledgment letter templates.\n    *   Access: Log in at [https://bayandbasin.sharepoint.com/](https://bayandbasin.sharepoint.com/) with organizational credentials.\n*   **DocuSign:** Secure electronic signature for official tax receipts, if required.\n    *   Access: Log in at [https://account.docusign.com/](https://account.docusign.com/) with organizational credentials.\n\n**5) Step-by-Step Instructions**\n\n1.  **Extract Monthly Donor Data (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   Navigate to Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT.\n    *   Go to \"Gifts\" > \"Gift Batches.\"\n    *   Create a new query for \"Recurring Gifts Processed in [Previous Month].\" Filter by \"Gift Date\" between the 1st and last day of the previous month and \"Gift Type\" = \"Recurring Gift.\"\n    *   Export the query results, including donor name, address, gift amount, gift date, and constituent ID.\n    *   Estimated Time: 15 minutes.\n2.  **Generate Acknowledgment Queue (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   Within Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT, navigate to \"Appeal\" > \"Acknowledgment Letters.\"\n    *   Click \"Add\" to create a new acknowledgment queue.\n    *   Name the queue \"Monthly Acks [Previous Month Year]\" (e.g., \"Monthly Acks January 2025\").\n    *   Select the query created in Step 1.\n    *   Ensure \"Send via email\" is selected if preferred, or \"Print\" for physical mail.\n    *   Estimated Time: 10 minutes.\n3.  **Perform Mail Merge for Letters (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   From the acknowledgment queue, select \"Generate Letters.\"\n    *   Choose the \"Monthly Donor Acknowledgment Template\" from the available templates. (Placeholder: *Raiser's Edge NXT Mail Merge Template selection screen*).\n    *   Review the merge fields to ensure accuracy (e.g., donor name, aggregate monthly total).\n    *   Generate the merged documents into a Microsoft Word file.\n    *   Estimated Time: 30 minutes.\n4.  **Review and Edit Letters (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   Open the generated Microsoft Word document.\n    *   Conduct a thorough review for any merging errors, formatting issues, or specific donor notes that may require customization.\n    *   Save the finalized document as \"Monthly Donor Acks [Previous Month Year].docx\" in SharePoint > Development > Donor Communications > Acknowledgments > [Year].\n    *   Estimated Time: 45 minutes.\n5.  **Generate IRS Tax Receipts (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   For donations meeting the threshold requiring specific IRS disclosures (currently $250 or more for individual gifts, or aggregate for monthly donors if it exceeds this and a single receipt is desired), create separate IRS-compliant receipts.\n    *   Utilize the \"IRS Tax Receipt Template.docx\" located in SharePoint > Development > Templates.\n    *   Merge relevant data from the exported donor list (Step 1) into this template.\n    *   Generate individual PDFs for each donor requiring a specific tax receipt.\n    *   Estimated Time: 30 minutes.\n6.  **Secure Electronic Signatures (if applicable, Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   If official signatures are required for IRS tax receipts (e.g., for very large gifts or specific funder agreements), upload the generated PDFs to DocuSign.\n    *   Route for signature to the Chief Development Officer.\n    *   Estimated Time: 15 minutes.\n7.  **Distribute Acknowledgment Letters and Receipts (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   **Email:** For donors with an email preference, convert the Word document to PDF and attach to a new email. Use the \"Monthly Donor Acknowledgment Email Template\" (see Step 9). Attach the individual IRS tax receipt if applicable.\n    *   **Mail:** For donors with a mail preference, print the letters and receipts. Prepare for mailing, including folding, stuffing, and postage.\n    *   Estimated Time: 60 minutes.\n8.  **Update Raiser's Edge NXT Records (Donor Relations Manager):**\n    *   Navigate back to the acknowledgment queue in Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT.\n    *   Mark all processed acknowledgments as \"Acknowledged\" with the current date.\n    *   Add a note to each recurring gift record confirming \"Monthly acknowledgment letter and receipt sent [Date].\"\n    *   Estimated Time: 20 minutes.\n\n    **Mini-Checklist:**\n    *   \u2713 All monthly donors identified in query.\n    *   \u2713 Acknowledgment letters generated and reviewed.\n    *   \u2713 IRS tax receipts generated (if applicable).\n    *   \u2713 All documents distributed via preferred method.\n    *   \u2713 Raiser's Edge NXT updated for all acknowledged gifts.\n\n**6) Definition of Done / Quality Standards**\nThe process is considered complete when:\n*   \u2713 All monthly donors from the previous month have received an acknowledgment letter.\n*   \u2713 All donors requiring an IRS tax receipt have received one, either within the acknowledgment letter or as a separate document.\n*   \u2713 All acknowledgment documents are saved as PDFs in SharePoint > Development > Donor Communications > Acknowledgments > [Year] > [Month].\n*   \u2713 The \"Acknowledgments\" queue in Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT is cleared with all gifts marked as acknowledged.\n*   \u2713 Individual gift records in Raiser's Edge NXT are updated with the acknowledgment date.\n\n**7) Troubleshooting**\n*   **If Gift Not Appearing in Query:** Verify gift entry date and type. If an error, correct the gift record in Raiser's Edge NXT, then re-run the query.\n*   **If Mail Merge Error:** Check donor records for missing or incorrect fields (e.g., blank address). Correct data and regenerate. If persistent, restart the merge process.\n*   **If Donor Declines a Receipt:** Note this preference clearly in the Raiser's Edge NXT constituent record's \"Comments\" section. Send a warm thank-you only, omitting any tax receipt language.\n*   **If System Outage (Raiser's Edge NXT):** Utilize the \"Backup Donor Data (Monthly Recurring)\" Excel file in SharePoint. Generate letters and receipts using the Word templates manually. Keep a log of all actions taken and update Raiser's Edge NXT retrospectively upon system restoration.\n*   **If Template Corruption:** Access the master templates in SharePoint > Development > Templates > Master Copies. Do not edit master copies directly. Create a new working copy from the master.\n\n**8) Data, Privacy, and Accessibility**\n*   **PII Handling:** All personally identifiable information (PII) of donors must be handled with the utmost confidentiality. Access to donor data is restricted to authorized personnel. Data must not be shared outside Bay & Basin Conservancy unless explicitly permitted by the donor or required by law.\n*   **IRS Charitable Contribution Receipt Rules:** Adhere strictly to IRS Publication 1771, Charitable Contributions \u2014 Substantiation and Disclosure Requirements.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**Total Steps: 12 | Estimated Time: 90\u2013120 minutes**\n\n### A. Data Extraction (15 minutes)\n\n**Step 1.** Log in to Raiser's Edge NXT at https://login.blackbaud.com using @baybasin.org credentials.\n\n**Step 2.** Navigate to **Records > Gifts > Acknowledgments Queue** (bookmark this view for recurring use).\n\n**Step 3.** Filter by:\n   - Gift Date: First day to last day of prior month (e.g., for January letters, filter 12/01/2024\u201312/31/2024)\n   - Gift Type: All revenue types except pledges and in-kind (non-cash)\n   - Acknowledgment Status: \"Not Acknowledged\"\n\n**Step 4.** Export results to Excel: Click **Actions > Export > Excel (with all fields)**.

Data Review and Segmentation (20 minutes)\n\n**Step 5.** Open exported Excel file. Review for data quality:\n   - Confirm all donor names, addresses, and email fields are populated.\n   - Flag any PO Box addresses for physical mail; email-only donors receive digital receipts.\n   - Identify gifts \u2265$1,000: These require personalized acknowledgment (see Step 9).\n\n**Step 6.** Create two Excel tabs by copying records:\n   - **Tab 1:** \"Standard Receipts\" (<$1,000; n=~130)\n   - **Tab 2:** \"Personalized Letters\" (\u2265$1,000; n=~15\u201320)\n\n**Step 7.** For **each tab**, verify IRS-compliant fields are complete:\n   - Donor legal name (individual or organization)\n   - Gift amount (USD)\n   - Gift date\n   - \"No goods or services were provided in exchange\" statement (auto-generated in template)\n   - Bay & Basin Conservancy EIN: 94-1234567\n\n---\n\n### C.

Save merged file as `YYYYMM_Standard_Receipts_MERGED.docx` in SharePoint > Development > Monthly Receipts > 2025.\n\n**Step 12.** Convert to PDF: **File > Save As > PDF**. File name: `YYYYMM_Standard_Receipts.pdf`.\n\n---\n\n### D. Personalized Letters \u2013 Major Gifts (25 minutes)\n\n**Step 13.** For each donor in Tab 2 (\"Personalized Letters\"), open a **new** Word document from template `IRS_Tax_Receipt_2025.docx`.\n\n**Step 14.** Manually insert:\n   - Donor name and mailing address\n   - Personal note (1\u20132 sentences) referencing donor history or program impact; consult Raiser's Edge NXT biographical notes under **Records > Constituents > [Donor Name] > Notes**.\n   - Gift details and EIN as in Step 7.\n\n**Step 15.** Save each letter individually: `YYYYMM_LastName_FirstName_Receipt.pdf` in SharePoint > Development > Monthly Receipts > 2025 > Personalized.\n\n**Decision Point:** Gifts \u2265$5,000 require Development Director co-signature via DocuSign. Upload PDF to DocuSign, route to Sandra Liu (sliu@baybasin.org) for signature, then to donor.\n\n---\n\n### E.

TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n| **Issue** | **Solution** |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Raiser's Edge NXT unavailable** | Use prior month's Excel export as template; manually add new gifts from gift entry log (Google Sheet backup). Sync to RE NXT upon restoration. Notify Development Operations Analyst. |\n| **Donor email bounces** | Check CRM for alternate email. If none, mail physical letter to address on file. Update email status to \"Undeliverable\" in RE NXT. |\n| **Donor requests receipt re-send** | Retrieve PDF from SharePoint archive; re-send via email same business day. Log request in RE NXT Notes: \"Receipt re-sent [date] per donor request.\" |\n| **Missing gift data (no amount or date)** | Do not generate receipt. Escalate to Development Operations Analyst to correct gift record.

It perfectly balances formal tone with practical usability, includes all required sections with appropriate detail, and provides actionable steps a new staff member could follow immediately. Minor deductions only for a small compliance detail and length slightly exceeding the suggested range.",

          "Excellent compliance integration\u2014IRS Pub 1771, GDPR, and CCPA requirements woven naturally into workflow rather than treated as afterthought",
          "Highly practical troubleshooting section with realistic scenarios (bounced emails, anonymous donors, international gifts) and clear solutions",
          "Strong data segmentation logic (standard vs. personalized, <$1,000 vs. \u2265$1,000) that reflects actual nonprofit development practice",

          "The DocuSign signature requirement for gifts \u2265$5,000 is unusual in practice\u2014most nonprofits don't require co-signatures on routine tax receipts, even for major gifts; this may create unnecessary bottleneck",
