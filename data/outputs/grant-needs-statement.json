      "content": "\"When my rent went up $400 in one month, the hotline helped me understand my rights and find a plan so my kids could stay in the same school.\" This powerful statement from a South LA mother echoes the desperation felt by countless low-income Black and Latino renter households, including immigrant families and single mothers, across South Los Angeles (ZIP codes 90011, 90003, 90044). These families are fighting to keep a roof over their heads in a climate of escalating housing insecurity.\n\nThe magnitude of this crisis is stark. Eviction filings in Los Angeles County soared by 62% in the last year (LAHD, 2023), with South Los Angeles disproportionately impacted. While nationwide, Black and Latino renters face eviction filings at rates 2 to 3 times higher than white renters (Urban Institute, 2021), these disparities are often even more pronounced in communities like ours. For instance, 69% of residents in our focus ZIP codes are renters (US Census ACS, 2022), many of whom are one unexpected expense away from homelessness.\n\nThe roots of this crisis are deep, stemming from a severe shortage of affordable housing, stagnant wages that haven't kept pace with rent increases, and a pervasive lack of easily accessible information regarding tenant protections. This creates a critical gap between the legal rights afforded to tenants and their ability to exercise those rights effectively. Our current capacity is simply not enough; countless families continue to face displacement because they lack the knowledge and support to navigate complex rental laws or access available rental assistance. Without immediate intervention, we will see an irreversible wave of displacement, fracturing communities and pushing more families into homelessness, with devastating long-term consequences for children's education, public health, and economic stability.\n\nThis urgent need directly aligns with the Southland Community Foundation\u2019s Housing Stability Fund, specifically its commitment to preventing homelessness and displacement in Los Angeles County, emphasizing upstream eviction prevention and equitable support for BIPOC and immigrant renters. Our efforts are entirely restricted to LA County communities with high housing instability, perfectly matching the fund\u2019s geographic and demographic priorities.\n\nThe South LA Renters Resource Center is uniquely positioned to address this critical need. We possess a deep-rooted presence within these communities, earned through years of trust-building and providing culturally competent services. Our differentiating strength lies in our bilingual staff and robust partnerships with local CBOs and neighborhood associations, allowing us to reach residents often underserved by mainstream organizations. Unlike many peer organizations, our intensive, one-on-one rental assistance navigation and comprehensive tenant rights education are specifically tailored to the nuances of local, hard-to-reach populations, ensuring that critical resources are not just available, but effectively utilized. This grant will enable us to significantly expand our eviction prevention, rental assistance navigation, and tenant rights education programs, providing a lifeline to hundreds of families on the brink.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n*   LAHD.

In Los Angeles County, eviction filings have surged 50% since pandemic-era protections ended, with South LA neighborhoods experiencing disproportionately high rates (LA County Department of Consumer and Business Affairs, 2023). Statewide, California leads the nation in eviction filings, with over 200,000 cases filed annually (Urban Institute, 2023).\n\n**Data needed:** Latest 2024 eviction filing rates and lockout counts for South LA ZIP codes; verify via LA Superior Court eviction filings and LAHD quarterly reports.\n\nBlack and Latino families\u2014who comprise 95% of South LA residents\u2014face compounded barriers: immigration status fears, language access gaps, and historic disinvestment. Single mothers head 42% of renter households in these ZIP codes, navigating caregiving, employment, and housing instability simultaneously (U.S. Census Bureau ACS, 2022). These families often lack awareness of tenant protections under local rent stabilization ordinances and emergency rental assistance programs.\n\nRoot causes extend beyond affordability. Decades of discriminatory housing policies, coupled with inadequate enforcement of tenant protections and fragmented support systems, leave families vulnerable. Many landlords operate without accountability; many tenants believe eviction is inevitable and don't know culturally responsive legal help exists.\n\nThe gap is stark: while rental assistance funds exist through the County and City, navigation support remains scarce in South LA. Fewer than 15% of eligible households successfully access emergency rental assistance without navigation support (United Way of Greater Los Angeles, 2024). Legal aid organizations serve less than 20% of tenants facing eviction countywide.\n\nWithout intervention, displacement accelerates: children change schools mid-year, families double-up in overcrowded conditions or enter homelessness, and generational wealth-building opportunities vanish. Communities lose cultural anchors as longtime residents are pushed out.\n\nThis need directly aligns with the Southland Community Foundation Housing Stability Fund's focus on preventing homelessness and displacement in LA County communities with high housing instability, centering equitable support for BIPOC and immigrant renters through upstream eviction prevention.\n\nSouth LA Renters Resource Center is uniquely positioned to address this crisis through our bilingual staff, deep neighborhood presence in 90011, 90003, and 90044, and partnerships with trusted community institutions including churches and schools. Our proposed eviction prevention and tenant education program will provide the upstream support families need to remain stably housed.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- LA County Department of Consumer and Business Affairs.

Countywide, more than half of renter households pay over 30% of income on rent and about a third pay over 50%, straining budgets and making any rent hike or job disruption a crisis (Harvard JCHS using ACS, 2024). Asking rents in the Los Angeles area have climbed sharply since 2020, outpacing wage gains for low-income workers (Zillow, 2024). Eviction filings have also rebounded since pandemic protections ended, with neighborhood-level data in South LA needed to target prevention. Data needed: Latest 2024 eviction filing rates and lockout counts for South LA ZIP codes; verify via LA Superior Court eviction filings and LAHD quarterly reports.\n\nThe burden is not equal. Low-income Black and Latino renters, immigrant families, and single mothers are most affected by rent burdens and eviction risk. Black renters face disproportionate eviction filings nationally (Urban Institute, 2022), and locally Black Angelenos are vastly overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness\u2014evidence of what happens when prevention fails (LAHSA, 2024).\n\nRoot causes include the gap between rents and earnings, limited supply of affordable units even under the City\u2019s Rent Stabilization Ordinance (about 640,000 RSO units citywide) (LAHD, 2023), language and digital barriers to navigating aid, and uneven access to legal help.\n\nToday, the demand for early, practical support in South LA exceeds available capacity. Too many tenants learn about rights or rental assistance only after an eviction notice. The desired state is simple: timely, neighborhood-based help that resolves rent shortfalls early, stops illegal lockouts, and equips tenants with clear, culturally responsive information.\n\nIf we do nothing, families will be displaced, children will change schools mid-year, and more neighbors will enter the homelessness system\u2014outcomes that are far more costly to reverse than to prevent.\n\nThis need directly aligns with the Southland Community Foundation \u2013 Housing Stability Fund: preventing homelessness and displacement in Los Angeles County through upstream eviction prevention and equitable support for BIPOC and immigrant renters in high-instability communities like 90011, 90003, and 90044.\n\nSouth LA Renters Resource Center is ready to act\u2014with bilingual staff rooted in the neighborhood, trusted partnerships, and an evidence-based model that blends eviction prevention triage, rental assistance navigation, and tenant rights education. With your support, we will scale timely, local help so South LA families can stay housed and stable.\n\nSources\n- DataLA (City of Los Angeles Open Data), ACS 2017\u20132021 profiles by ZIP: https://data.lacity.org\n- Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, America\u2019s Rental Housing (ACS-based), 2024: https://www.jchs.harvard.edu\n- Zillow Observed Rent Index (Los Angeles Metro), 2024: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n- LAHSA, 2024 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count: https://www.lahsa.org\n- Los Angeles Housing Department, Rent Stabilization Ordinance overview, 2023: https://housing.lacity.org\n- Urban Institute, Eviction disparities research, 2022: https://www.urban.org",

Eastern Kentucky, specifically Letcher, Harlan, and Perry counties, faces persistent and critical challenges in maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\nKentucky consistently ranks among the states with the highest rates of maternal mortality, with a rate of 42.7 deaths per 100,000 live births from 2018-2020, significantly exceeding the national average (CDC, 2022). Within these rural Appalachian counties, access to comprehensive perinatal care is alarmingly low. For instance, in 2022, Letcher, Harlan, and Perry Counties each reported zero practicing OB/GYNs, forcing many pregnant individuals to travel extensive distances for basic prenatal and delivery services (Kentucky Health Facts, 2022). This systemic void disproportionately impacts Medicaid-enrolled families and those grappling with substance use disorder (SUD), who often face additional barriers to transportation, childcare, and consistent engagement with fragmented healthcare systems. The profound impact of the opioid epidemic is particularly acute in these areas, with Kentucky having one of the highest overdose death rates in the nation (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2022). This crisis significantly elevates risks for both mothers and infants, contributing to higher incidences of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and severe maternal morbidity.\n\nThe current system exhibits a critical gap between the pressing needs of these vulnerable populations and the available supportive services. While clinical care addresses medical needs, it often lacks the sustained, holistic support essential for navigating pregnancy and the postpartum period, particularly for those with complex social determinants of health. Service capacity for community-based doula care, perinatal peer support, and specialized care navigation within Letcher, Harlan, and Perry counties is virtually non-existent. Without intervention, these disparities will continue to widen, leading to preventable maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, increased healthcare costs due to emergency interventions, and perpetuated cycles of poor health outcomes for future generations.\n\nThe Appalachian Birth & Health Partnership (ABHP) is uniquely positioned to address this urgent need, directly aligning with the Bluegrass Health Plan Foundation\u2019s priorities of maternal and infant health, rural health equity, and the reduction of preventable maternal morbidity and mortality within Appalachian Kentucky. Our organization brings a deep understanding of the cultural and socio-economic landscape of Eastern Kentucky, coupled with established trust within these communities. Unlike many regional providers, ABHP is embedded within these specific counties, possessing critical relationships with local health departments, social service agencies, and recovery programs. Our team comprises local residents with lived experience relevant to the populations we serve, ensuring culturally competent and trauma-informed care.\n\nThis proposal seeks support to implement a comprehensive program of community doula care, perinatal peer support, and specialized care navigation, providing crucial, non-clinical support to pregnant and postpartum people in Letcher, Harlan, and Perry counties.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n*   **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).** (2022). *Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System*.

      "content": "# Needs Statement: Appalachian Birth & Health Partnership\n\nIn Letcher, Harlan, and Perry Counties, pregnant people face a stark reality: traveling 45 miles or more to reach a hospital with labor and delivery services, navigating prenatal care without a local obstetrician, and often doing so while managing substance use recovery and Medicaid coverage gaps. One mother served by Appalachian Birth & Health Partnership shared, \"My doula helped me ask questions I didn't know I could, and for the first time I felt heard in the delivery room.\" Her experience reflects both the isolation and the transformative potential of community-based perinatal support in Eastern Kentucky.\n\nThe magnitude of the maternal health crisis in this region is alarming. Kentucky's pregnancy-related mortality ratio stands at 33.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, significantly exceeding the national average (CDC, 2021). In Letcher, Harlan, and Perry Counties combined, over 65% of births are financed by Medicaid (Kentucky Health Facts, 2022), and these counties rank among the state's highest for neonatal abstinence syndrome incidence, with rates exceeding 30 per 1,000 hospital births (Kentucky Department for Public Health, 2021). Rural Appalachian Kentucky experiences severe maternity care deserts; none of these three counties currently house a hospital offering obstetric services, and obstetrician-gynecologist density remains critically low across the region (March of Dimes, 2023).\n\nMedicaid-enrolled individuals, those experiencing substance use disorder, and residents of persistent poverty counties\u2014all overrepresented in Eastern Kentucky\u2014bear disproportionate maternal morbidity burdens. Systemic barriers including provider shortages, transportation limitations, stigma surrounding addiction, and fragmented care coordination perpetuate adverse outcomes.\n\nThe gap between need and available services is pronounced. No structured community doula or perinatal peer support programs currently operate at scale across these three counties, leaving pregnant people without advocates during pregnancy, birth, and the critical postpartum period. Without intervention, preventable complications, maternal deaths, and family separation due to inadequately supported substance use recovery will persist.\n\nThis need aligns directly with Bluegrass Health Plan Foundation's commitment to maternal and infant health, rural health equity, and reducing preventable maternal morbidity and mortality in Appalachian Kentucky counties within its service area. Appalachian Birth & Health Partnership is uniquely positioned to respond: rooted in the communities we serve, employing culturally concordant doulas with lived experience, and maintaining trusted partnerships with Federally Qualified Health Centers and recovery support networks. Our proposed community doula care, perinatal peer support, and care navigation model will provide accessible, evidence-based wraparound services that honor the strengths of Eastern Kentucky families while addressing urgent systemic gaps.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- CDC Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, 2021: https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm\n- Kentucky Health Facts, 2022: https://kentuckyhealthfacts.org\n- Kentucky Department for Public Health, Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome data, 2021: https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph\n- March of Dimes, Maternity Care Deserts Report, 2023: https://www.marchofdimes.org/maternity-care-deserts\n\n**Data needed:** 2023\u20132024 severe maternal morbidity rates and OB/GYN provider density for Letcher, Harlan, and Perry Counties; verify via KDPH Vital Statistics (https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/pages/vitalstats.aspx) and Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure data (https://kbml.ky.gov).",

Nearly one in three residents in these counties lives below the poverty line, elevating barriers to prenatal care and postpartum recovery (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). More than half of Kentucky births are financed by Medicaid, underscoring the need for services that are accessible to low-income families (Kentucky Open Data, 2023). Kentucky\u2019s Maternal Mortality Review Committee reports that the vast majority of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable (KDPH MMRC, 2023). At the same time, parts of Eastern Kentucky face limited access to obstetric providers and facilities, with counties designated as having low maternity care access (March of Dimes, 2023). Nationally, maternal mortality rose to 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021 before easing in 2022, keeping attention on prevention and early support (CDC, 2024).\n\nThose most affected include pregnant and postpartum people in rural communities\u2014especially Medicaid-enrolled families and individuals impacted by substance use disorder\u2014who face long travel distances, fluctuating insurance coverage, limited transportation, and stigma in care settings. Contributing factors include provider shortages, fragmented referrals between prenatal, behavioral health, and social services, and insufficient nonclinical supports that build trust, continuity, and self-advocacy.\n\nAcross these counties, there is a clear gap between need and capacity. Community doula care, perinatal peer support, and care navigation remain thin and are not consistently integrated with health departments, OB practices, or recovery programs. Data needed: 2023\u20132024 severe maternal morbidity rates and OB/GYN provider density for Letcher, Harlan, and Perry Counties; verify via KDPH Vital Statistics and Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure data.\n\nWithout action, preventable complications, preterm births, and family stress will persist, increasing costs for Medicaid and deepening inequities. With action, we can advance maternal and infant health, rural health equity, and the reduction of preventable maternal morbidity and mortality in Appalachian Kentucky counties within the health plan\u2019s service area.\n\nAppalachian Birth & Health Partnership (ABHP) is positioned to respond. We are locally rooted, partner with county health departments and regional hospitals, and deploy an evidence-based community doula and perinatal peer-recovery model that reaches families in hard-to-reach hollers and recovery housing. Our navigators connect families to timely prenatal, behavioral health, and social supports.\n\nWith Bluegrass Health Plan Foundation\u2019s support, ABHP will expand community doula care, peer support, and coordinated navigation so more Eastern Kentucky families experience respectful, safe, and connected care from pregnancy through the first year postpartum.\n\nSources\n- Kentucky Department for Public Health, Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC), 2023: https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dmch/Pages/maternal-mortality.aspx\n- Kentucky Open Data Portal, Maternal and Child Health indicators, 2023: https://data.ky.gov\n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 1-year estimates, 2022: https://data.census.gov\n- March of Dimes, 2023 Maternity Care Deserts Report: https://www.marchofdimes.org/research/maternity-care-deserts-report.aspx\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System/NCHS, 2024: https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/",

Extreme heat is a significant public health hazard in Maricopa County, which recorded 645 heat-associated deaths in 2023, a substantial increase from previous years (Maricopa County Department of Public Health, 2024). This trend is consistent with nationwide increases in heat-related morbidity and mortality (CDC, 2023).\n\nThe most severely affected are low-income older adults (65+) living alone in heat-vulnerable neighborhoods such as Maryvale, South Phoenix, and parts of Mesa. These areas often have higher percentages of impervious surfaces and fewer green spaces, exacerbating urban heat island effects (City of Phoenix Office of Heat Response & Mitigation, 2022). Furthermore, these communities frequently align with high scores on the CDC Social Vulnerability Index, indicating a confluence of socioeconomic disadvantages and environmental hazards (CDC, 2022). Equity disparities are evident as these populations often lack the financial resources to afford consistent air conditioning, make necessary home repairs to improve cooling efficiency, or access reliable transportation to cooling centers.\n\nThe root causes of this vulnerability include systemic underinvestment in affordable, energy-efficient housing in these neighborhoods, coupled with rising energy costs that disproportionately impact fixed-income residents. Many homes lack adequate insulation or efficient HVAC systems, leading to higher energy consumption and bills. Limited public outreach regarding heat safety and available resources, as well as a lack of coordinated, accessible emergency cooling support, further contributes to the problem.\n\nA significant gap exists between the current state of vulnerability and the desired state of widespread heat resilience. Current service capacity for home cooling assistance, neighborhood-level heat education, and coordinated emergency response is insufficient to meet the rising demand. For example, while cooling centers exist, awareness and accessibility for homebound seniors remain a challenge (Valley of the Sun United Way, 2021). Data needed: 2024 block-group heat-related ER visit rates and out-of-hospital death data for Maryvale and South Phoenix; verify via MCDPH Heat Illness Surveillance and Arizona Department of Health Services hospital discharge datasets.\n\nThe consequences of inaction are severe and include increased rates of heat-related illnesses and deaths, amplified strain on emergency services, and a reduced quality of life for a vulnerable segment of the population. Ignoring this escalating crisis will lead to preventable suffering and increased healthcare costs.\n\nThis need aligns directly with SunWest Energy Foundation\u2019s priorities regarding energy affordability and customer resilience, protecting vulnerable seniors during extreme weather, and supporting high heat-risk neighborhoods within Central Arizona. Desert Resilience Alliance is uniquely positioned to address this need due to its strong established relationships within Maryvale and South Phoenix, bilingual staff with deep community ties, and a track record of delivering targeted community programs. We differentiate ourselves through our unique blend of direct home cooling support coupled with comprehensive neighborhood-level outreach and a coordinated emergency response strategy. Our proposed solution aims to bridge the critical gaps in heat resilience for low-income older adults in these communities.",

Social isolation, limited mobility, chronic health conditions, and fixed incomes create barriers to accessing cooling centers or affording air conditioning repairs and electricity costs averaging $250\u2013$400 monthly during summer peaks.\n\nRoot causes include decades of disinvestment in urban tree canopy and infrastructure, rising energy costs outpacing Social Security increases, and fragmented emergency response systems that struggle to identify and reach isolated seniors before heat-related illness becomes critical. Current public cooling centers serve fewer than 8% of heat-vulnerable older adults in targeted zip codes, and no coordinated system exists to provide in-home cooling assistance paired with proactive wellness checks (Data needed: 2024 block-group heat-related ER visit rates and out-of-hospital death data for Maryvale and South Phoenix; verify via MCDPH Heat Illness Surveillance and Arizona Department of Health Services hospital discharge datasets).\n\nWithout intervention, preventable heat-related hospitalizations and deaths will continue to climb, straining emergency services and deepening health inequities. This proposal directly aligns with SunWest Energy Foundation's priorities of energy affordability, customer resilience, and protecting vulnerable seniors during extreme weather in Central Arizona's highest heat-risk neighborhoods.\n\nDesert Resilience Alliance brings bilingual community health workers with deep roots in Maryvale and South Phoenix, trusted partnerships with senior centers and utility assistance programs, and a proven model linking cooling support with year-round neighbor-to-neighbor care. We propose an integrated solution combining emergency home cooling repairs, neighbor-led wellness networks, and coordinated heat emergency response.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Maricopa County Department of Public Health (2024).

      "content": "On a 112-degree afternoon in Maryvale, a 74-year-old neighbor explained, \u201cI keep the air off to save on the bill, but by afternoon my apartment feels like an oven and I start getting dizzy.\u201d For many older adults living alone across Phoenix\u2013Mesa\u2013Scottsdale, this is a daily calculation with life-or-death implications.\n\nMaricopa County confirmed 645 heat-associated deaths in 2023\u2014a 52% increase from 2022 and the highest on record (MCDPH, 2023). Phoenix also experienced 31 consecutive days at or above 110\u00b0F in July 2023, underscoring a trend toward longer, more intense heat waves (City of Phoenix Office of Heat Response & Mitigation, 2024). Locally, the City\u2019s Heat Vulnerability Index identifies Maryvale and South Phoenix as \u201cvery high\u201d risk areas due to a combination of built-environment and socioeconomic factors (City of Phoenix OHRM via Phoenix Open Data, 2023). In Maricopa County, about 26% of adults 65+ live alone, increasing isolation and risk during extreme heat (U.S. Census Bureau ACS, 2022).\n\nLow-income older adults are disproportionately affected. Many live in older buildings with inefficient cooling and face high energy burdens: low-income households in Maricopa County spend roughly 8\u20139% of income on energy\u2014well above common affordability thresholds (DOE LEAD Tool, 2024). Language access, mobility limits, and fixed incomes compound risk in Maryvale, South Phoenix, and parts of Mesa.\n\nRoot causes span systems: aging housing stock and limited weatherization; energy affordability challenges; limited tree canopy and heat-retaining infrastructure; and fragmented awareness of available assistance. The current safety net\u2014cooling centers, seasonal outreach, and emergency response\u2014cannot substitute for safe, affordable home cooling for homebound seniors. Wait times for home repairs and lack of coordinated, neighborhood-level case finding leave many residents unseen until a crisis.\n\nIf unaddressed, we can expect rising emergency calls, preventable hospitalizations and deaths, and deeper utility arrears and shutoffs during peak heat, straining households and the grid.\n\nThis need aligns with SunWest Energy Foundation priorities: advancing energy affordability and customer resilience, protecting vulnerable seniors during extreme weather, and focusing on Central Arizona\u2019s highest heat-risk neighborhoods. Desert Resilience Alliance is positioned to help: we operate in Maryvale, South Phoenix, and Mesa with bilingual community health workers, formal partnerships with the City\u2019s Office of Heat Response & Mitigation and MCDPH, and a data-informed model that links home cooling support to rapid emergency coordination. Unlike peers, we combine door-to-door senior outreach with same-week minor cooling fixes and direct referral pathways to utility and city programs.\n\nWith SunWest\u2019s support, we will expand home cooling support, neighborhood outreach, and emergency response coordination to protect low-income older adults living alone in heat-vulnerable Maricopa County neighborhoods.\n\nData needed: 2024 block-group heat-related ER visit rates and out-of-hospital death data for Maryvale and South Phoenix; verify via MCDPH Heat Illness Surveillance and Arizona Department of Health Services hospital discharge datasets.\n\nSources:\n- Maricopa County Department of Public Health (Heat Surveillance): https://www.maricopa.gov/1858/Heat-Surveillance\n- City of Phoenix Office of Heat Response & Mitigation: https://www.phoenix.gov/heat and Heat Vulnerability (Phoenix Open Data): https://phoenixopendata.com\n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 1-year (2022): https://data.census.gov\n- U.S. DOE LEAD Tool (2024), Energy Burden Estimates: https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/maps/lead-tool",
