          "Logistics overload: Includes every optional detail in the main caption, creating a wall of text that would perform poorly on mobile Facebook",
          "Repetitive phrasing: 'Free kits are limited to the first 50 households, while supplies last' appears twice in each caption (once in body, once at end)",
          "Missing emoji usage: Prompt allows 0-2 emojis for clarity/warmth; none used despite warm tone and family-focused audience",
          "Version B hook is weaker (question format less urgent than Version A's direct benefit statement)",
