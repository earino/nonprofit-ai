        "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally well-structured board minutes template that perfectly matches the FACTUAL/ORGANIZED tone requested. It includes all required elements with professional formatting appropriate for a large, established nonprofit like Pacific Flyway Conservation Trust. The template is comprehensive, legally sound, and immediately usable.",
        "strengths": [
          "Excellent organizational structure with clear hierarchical sections that follow nonprofit governance best practices",
          "Comprehensive coverage of all prompt requirements: attendees, absent members, votes/resolutions with detailed vote counts, key discussion points, action items with owners and deadlines, and next meeting details",
          "Professional formatting with bracketed placeholders that make it easy to fill in actual information",
          "Includes important governance elements beyond the basic requirements: quorum notation, recusal tracking, resolution effective dates, approval signatures, and attachments section",
          "Perfectly matches the FACTUAL/ORGANIZED tone with formal language, precise formatting, and structured data fields",
          "Legally appropriate with proper documentation of motions, votes, and approvals suitable for a $40M+ organization",
          "Practical features like meeting ID, time zones, agenda submission deadlines, and responsible parties for implementation"

          "Slightly generic in that it doesn't incorporate any conservation/environmental-specific elements that might be relevant to Pacific Flyway Conservation Trust (though this actually increases its versatility)",
          "Could optionally include a 'Conflicts of Interest Declared' section, which is common for large nonprofits with corporate partnerships"
