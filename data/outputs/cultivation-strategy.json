(Example: Site visit with program lead to observe [PROGRAM]; objective: connect impact to values; question: \u201cHow do you assess philanthropic priorities this year?\u201d)\n- Mix formats; each touch must deliver substance (impact data, beneficiary voice, field insight, invitation to advise), not \u201cjust checking in.\u201d\n- Roles & Coordination: when/why to involve [ED/BOARD INVOLVEMENT]/volunteer solicitor; briefing notes and follow-up responsibilities.\n- Engagement Signals & Decision Gates: define readiness (responsiveness, outcome questions, budget curiosity, referral offered) and what triggers the ask.\n- Draft Ask Path: framing for [PROPOSED ASK RANGE], designation options, likely objections with 1\u20132 sentence responses; identify the natural ask moment tied to a specific touch/event.\n- Tracking: specify updates/tasks in [SYSTEM/CRM], fields to update, and simple metrics (meeting secured/site visit completed/pre-ask commitment).\n- Capacity-aware: realistic for team of [TEAM SIZE]; include low-cost options and time estimates per touch.\n- Include key dates: [KEY DATES/EVENTS] and any deadlines (board meetings, fiscal year-end).\n- Word count: 600\u2013900 words; internal planning document.\n- Tone: [TONE: FORMAL (board-ready, precise) / WARM (relationship-centered, professional) / CASUAL (clear, small-shop shorthand)].\n- Header lists: Prepared by [PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP OWNER]; Reviewed by [ED/BOARD LEAD].\n\nQuality: Be donor-centered, concrete, and sequenced. Avoid clich\u00e9s, guilt appeals, org-centric jargon, and vague \u201ctouches.\u201d Each touch must have a purpose, owner, and date window. Common pitfalls to avoid: involving ED/Board too early/late, stacking asks without value, or failing to document next steps within 48 hours.",

      "content": "## Red River Literacy Project: Evelyn Cho Major Donor Cultivation Plan\n\n**Prepared by:** Marcus Hill, Development Coordinator\n**Reviewed by:** Ana Delgado, Executive Director\n\n### 1) Prospect Snapshot\n\n**Evelyn Cho**\n*   **Estimated Capacity:** $50,000\u2013$150,000 over 12\u201318 months\n*   **Assets:** Owns three successful local laundromats (Cho\u2019s Cleaners). Recently sold a commercial property, indicating significant liquidity.\n*   **Affinity Indicators:** Known for her active participation in local business associations and community events. We've seen her volunteer at the annual school supply drive. Strong family values, often bringing her nieces and nephews to community literacy events.\n*   **Prior Giving:** No direct prior giving to Red River Literacy Project. Known to support local education-focused charities, specifically those aiding underprivileged youth. (Need to dig into specifics if possible through publicly available info or connectors.)\n*   **Decision-Making Process:** Appears to be data-driven and impact-focused. Values practical solutions and tangible results. Likely consults with her financial advisor or business manager for larger charitable decisions.\n*   **Known Connectors:** Susan Chen (Board member, owner of Chen's Hardware - they served on the Chamber of Commerce board together), David Kim (local real estate agent, facilitated her property sale, also a Red River Literacy Project casual donor).\n*   **Preferred Communication:** Seems to prefer direct, concise communication. Likely email for initial contact, but appreciates in-person updates and demonstrations of impact.\n\n### 2) Cultivation Goal & Case\n\n**Goal:** Secure a gift of $25,000\u2013$40,000 from Evelyn Cho within 9 months (by December 2024) to support the launch of the Mobile Reading Lab.\n\n**Case:** Evelyn Cho has a clear alignment with our mission of fostering literacy in underserved communities, particularly those we aim to serve with the Mobile Reading Lab. This initiative directly addresses a critical need in trailer parks and farmworker camps, providing equitable access to books and literacy support. Her likely appreciation for practical solutions and measurable impact makes the Mobile Reading Lab a perfect fit, offering a tangible way for her to invest in the education and future of local children. The Mobile Reading Lab represents an innovative, community-based approach, and Evelyn's support would be instrumental in bringing this vision to life.\n\n### 3) Strategy & Timeline (9 Months: April - December 2024)\n\nOur strategy focuses on building a relationship based on shared values, demonstrating our impact, and showcasing the innovative nature of the Mobile Reading Lab. We will involve key internal stakeholders strategically to build trust and leverage established connections.\n\n*   **April-May:** Initial connection via peer, low-key engagement, inviting participation in visible community events.\n*   **June-July:** Deeper engagement, introducing her to our program work, specifically the vision for the Mobile Reading Lab.\n*   **August-September:** Demonstrating proof of concept or initial pilot impact, providing opportunities for advice and insight.\n*   **October-December:** Pre-ask conversations, leading to a thoughtful and well-timed ask.\n\n### 4) Touchpoint Plan\n\n(Targeting 6 touches over 9 months, averaging one every 1.5 months. Time estimates exclude development of materials which will be done in batches.)\n\n| Touch Objective                                       | Donor Value                                                                  | Format                                                                                                                                                                                | Owner          | Date Window    | Materials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Qualification Question                                              | Time Est.

Pre-Ask Discussion & Impact Refinement             | Final clarity on impact, alignment of values, investment opportunity         | Conversation with Ana (and potentially Marcus) to discuss her philanthropic interests more directly in context of Mobile Reading Lab readiness.                               | Ana Delgado    | Mid-Oct        | Updated Mobile Reading Lab proposal with key strategies, impact metrics, and funding needs revised based on earlier feedback; funding tiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \"If you were to invest in a project like this, what kind of impact would feel most meaningful to you, and how would you like to see that impact measured?\" | 60               |\n\n### 5) Engagement Signals & Decision Gates\n\n**Engagement Signals (Readiness Indicators):**\n*   **Responsiveness:** Prompt replies to communication, proactive outreach.\n*   **Outcome Questions:** Asks about specific metrics, impact data, or timelines.\n*   **Budget Curiosity:** Inquires about program costs, funding needs, or operational expenses.\n*   **Referral Offered:** Offers to connect us with other potential supporters or resources.\n*   **Specific Advice:** Offers valuable, actionable advice during advising touches.\n*   **Active Participation:** Attends events, engages in discussions beyond polite conversation.\n*   **Shared Values:** Clearly articulates alignment with Red River Literacy Project's mission.\n\n**Decision Gates (Triggers for Ask):**\nThe ask will be triggered when Evelyn has demonstrated:\n1.  **Clear comprehension** of the Mobile Reading Lab's mission, scope, and target communities.\n2.  **Expressed enthusiasm** for the project's potential impact.\n3.  **Active participation** in at least 3-4 meaningful touches, including a site visit or significant advisory role.\n4.  **Positive direct feedback** during the pre-ask discussion with Ana, indicating readiness for a significant investment.\n5.  *Ideally*, has proactively asked about funding needs/how she can help.\n\n### 6) Roles & Coordination\n\n*   **Marcus Hill (Development Coordinator):** Primary relationship manager. Schedules all touches, prepares briefing notes for ED/Board, drafts all materials, handles follow-up within 48 hours of each touch, records all interactions in Bloomerang.\n*   **Ana Delgado (Executive Director):** Leads high-level conversations, demonstrates organizational vision, and articulates impact. Involved for the **Back-to-School Book Fair (Touch 3), Strategic Advising (Touch 4), and the Pre-Ask Conversation (Touch 6)**, and will lead the final ask. Briefed by Marcus 1 week prior to each interaction.\n*   **Susan Chen (Board Member):** Provides the initial warm **peer introduction (Touch 1)**. Briefed by Marcus on Evelyn\u2019s profile and the purpose of the intro phone call 1 week in advance. Will be brought in for the **final ask** if Marcus determines her presence would be beneficial and Evelyn has expressed a desire for peer involvement. Briefing notes will be comprehensive.\n*   **Coordination:** Weekly check-ins between Marcus and Ana to review Evelyn's cultivation progress. Bi-weekly updates to relevant Board members (Susan) via email. All meeting notes and action items to be recorded in Bloomerang immediately.\n\n### 7) Risks/Contingencies\n\n*   **Risk:** Evelyn becomes unresponsive or declines invitations.\n    *   **Contingency:** Pivot to a \"re-engagement\" strategy, perhaps a relevant program update via mail, or a phone call from Marcus just to \"check in\" and offer a less time-intensive engagement option. Re-evaluate preferred communication.\n*   **Risk:** She expresses disinterest in the Mobile Reading Lab specifically.\n    *   **Contingency:** Gently pivot to other impactful Red River Literacy Project programs. Revisit her initial \"passion points\" from the first touch.\n*   **Risk:** Her financial capacity changes unexpectedly.\n    *   **Contingency:** Continue cultivation at a lower intensity, maintaining the relationship for future opportunities. Adjust ask range if new information suggests a different capacity.\n*   **Risk:** Over-solicitation (too many asks, or too direct too early).\n    *   **Contingency:** Strict adherence to the touchpoint plan, ensuring each interaction provides value *before* any talk of funding. Marcus and Ana will review each touch to ensure it\u2019s donor-centric.\n\n### 8) Tracking & Next Steps\n\n*   **Platform:** Bloomerang CRM.\n*   **Fields to Update:** Communication log, next step date, next step description, donor interests, cultivation stage, engagement score, estimated capacity, connections.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Meeting secured rate (for each touch).\n    *   Site visit completed status.\n    *   Pre-ask commitment (verbal indication of interest).\n    *   Gift secured.\n*   **Next Steps Post-Touch:** Within 48 hours, Marcus will:\n    1.  Log all communication in Bloomerang.\n    2.  Update Evelyn\u2019s profile and engagement score.\n    3.  Schedule the next internal action (e.g., preparing for Ana's briefing, drafting next communication).\n    4.  Send a personalized follow-up to Evelyn.\n\n### 9) Draft Ask Path & Natural Moment\n\n**Natural Moment:** The natural ask moment aligns with the **Pre-Ask Discussion (Touch 6) and a subsequent meeting shortly after in late October/early November**, perhaps following a short proposal presention. This comes after Evelyn has provided specific input, witnessed impact, and discussed her philanthropic priorities with Ana. It feels like a natural progression from advisor to investor.\n\n**Framing for $25,000\u2013$40,000:**\n\"Evelyn, your insights into community engagement and operational logistics have been invaluable as we've refined the Mobile Reading Lab concept. You've seen firsthand the critical need, and you've helped us shape a truly impactful solution. We project that a gift of $25,000\u2013$40,000 would specifically allow us to equip the Mobile Reading Lab with its initial inventory of books and technology, and cover the first six months of community outreach and staffing dedicated to getting this crucial resource into the trailer parks and farmworker camps we discussed earlier this fall. Your investment at this level would put books directly into the hands of hundreds of children who currently have little to no access, transforming their opportunities for literacy and learning.\"\n\n**Designation Options (Flexible based on her preferences):**\n1.  **Direct Equipment & Materials:** Equipping the lab (books, learning materials, tablets).\n2.  **Launch Year Operations:** Covering the first 6-12 months of outreach, staffing, and basic program costs.\n3.  **Specific Community Sponsorship:** Designate the gift to fund specific communities for a set period.\n\n**Likely Objections (and 1-2 sentence responses):**\n*   **\"I need to think it over/discuss with my advisor.\"**\n    *   \"Absolutely, this is an important decision. I'd be happy to provide any additional information your advisor might need, and I can follow up with you early next week to see if you have any further questions.\"\n*   **\"The amount is a bit high.\"**\n    *   \"I understand it\u2019s a significant investment. We could explore different ways to break down the funding perhaps over two years, or focus your gift on one key component of the lab's launch, ensuring a specific, visible impact. What feels manageable while still achieving significant impact for these children?\"\n*   **\"How do you measure success?\"**\n    *   \"That's a very important question. We plan to track key metrics like the number of children served, books circulated, improvements in reading levels through pre/post assessments, and community engagement. We'd be happy to share our detailed plan with you.\"\n*   **\"I want to see it in action first.\"**\n    *   \"That's perfectly understandable. We are aiming for a soft launch early next year, and your support now would directly help us get it on the road faster.

Response: Year two blends city mini-grant + recurring gifts; your leadership gift unlocks a $20k community match we\u2019ve lined up.\n  - Concern: Recognition modesty. Response: We can keep it low-key (route nickname only) and focus recognition on family stories.\n- Natural ask moment: Touch 6 (Jun 12\u201320) after reviewing the two-page budget and naming menu, tied to fiscal year-end urgency and vendor pricing. Backup natural moment: Aug 12 Book Fair tour if June timing isn\u2019t right.",

ED/Board email Marcus within 2 hours post-touch with observations; Marcus logs and assigns follow-up tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 7) RISKS & CONTINGENCIES\n\n| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Evelyn's business faces unexpected downturn | Monitor local business news; have $15K \"phase 1 only\" option ready (vehicle purchase, defer retrofit). |\n| She wants to split gift with another donor | Embrace it\u2014offer co-naming; maintain her lead at $25K minimum. |\n| CPA sister advises delay until 2025 tax year | Pivot to pledge starting Jan 2025; secure verbal commitment in writing by Dec 31. |\n| Site visit feels staged/inauthentic | Use Maria's genuine relationships; let families lead conversation; avoid scripting. |\n| Other org makes competing ask | Emphasize local, visible impact she can drive by weekly; differentiate from national groups. |\n| We move too fast, skip value-building | Respect the 9-month timeline; if she accelerates, add a \"design session\" touch before ask. |\n\n---\n\n## 8) TRACKING & NEXT STEPS\n\n**Bloomerang fields to update after each touch:**  \n- Interaction date, type, owner  \n- Key quotes (verbatim, especially objections/questions)  \n- Engagement score (1\u20135 scale: responsiveness, depth of questions, referrals offered)  \n- Next action (who, what, by when)  \n- Likelihood rating (update monthly: 25% / 50% / 75% / 90%)\n\n**Metrics dashboard (monthly review):**  \n- Touches completed vs. planned  \n- Response rate (within 48 hours)  \n- Site visit confirmed (yes/no)  \n- Pre-ask conversation completed (yes/no)  \n- Proposal delivered (yes/no)  \n- Ask made (yes/no)  \n- Commitment secured (amount, timing)\n\n**Immediate next steps (April 2024):**  \n- [ ] Marcus schedules Touch 1 coffee by April 8  \n- [ ] Ana briefs Board at April 10 meeting on Mobile Lab case  \n- [ ] Marcus drafts 1-page Mobile Lab overview by April 15  \n- [ ] Confirm Maria Santos availability for June site visit by April 20  \n\n**48-hour rule:** After every touch, Marcus logs notes and sends thank-you/follow-up within 48 hours (email for Touches 1, 4; handwritten note for Touches 3, 7, 8).\n\n---\n\n## 9) DRAFT ASK PATH & NATURAL MOMENT\n\n**The ask (Touch 8, ~November):**  \n*\"Evelyn, over the past six months you've seen the need at Los Colores, helped us think through the operational model, and shared your vision for what's possible. We're ready to launch the Mobile Reading Lab, and we can't imagine doing this without you. **We're inviting you to anchor this initiative with a founding gift of $35,000\u2014or up to $40,000 if you'd like to include the bilingual collection expansion.** This covers the vehicle, retrofit, and six months of operations reaching 600 kids who currently have zero access. Would you partner with us?\"*\n\n**Designation options:**  \n- **$40,000:** Full project + enhanced bilingual collection; \"Founding Partner\" naming on van exterior + interior plaque  \n- **35,000:** Core launch package; \"Launch Partner\" interior plaque  \n- **$25,000:** Vehicle acquisition only; \"Community Partner\" recognition in annual report  \n- **Multi-year pledge:** $15K/year \u00d7 2 years (vehicle Year 1, operations Year 2)\n\n**Likely objections & responses:**\n\n*\"I need to talk to my sister (CPA) first.\"*  \n\"Absolutely\u2014here's a financial summary formatted for tax planning. When would make sense to reconnect after you two talk?\"\n\n*\"Can I see a detailed operational budget?\"*  \n\"Yes, here's the full breakdown [hand packet]. We've also built in a 6-month pilot evaluation\u2014you'll see exactly what's working before we ask you to continue.\"\n\n*\"What if the van breaks down or this doesn't work?\"*  \n\"Fair question. We're budgeting $4K for warranty/maintenance reserve, and we'll have a decision point at month 6. If outcomes don't match projections, we'll pivot the asset to stationary programming and refund any unspent restricted funds.\"\n\n*\"I was thinking more like $15K\u2013$20K.\"*  \n\"That's incredibly generous and would get us halfway to launch. If we paired your $20K with two other $10K donors, we could still move forward\u2014would you be open to introducing us to one potential co-funder from Rotary?\"\n\n**Natural ask moment:** Touch 8, scheduled 2\u20133 weeks after Touch 7 pre-ask conversation, ideally mid-November (before holiday distraction, after she's had time to consult her sister, and early enough to close by Dec 15 if she wants 2024 tax deduction).\n\n**If she says yes on the spot:** Have pledge form ready; confirm payment timing; schedule celebratory site visit for van delivery (Feb 2025 target). Thank her, then *stop talking.*\n\n**If she says \"let me think\":** Ask when she'll have an answer; send calendar hold for 20-minute follow-up call; reiterate that we're holding the naming opportunity for her until [specific date].\n\n---\n\n**TIME INVESTMENT ESTIMATE (Marcus):**  \n- Touch prep/execution: ~4 hours each \u00d7 8 = 32 hours  \n- Briefing memos, materials, follow-up: ~12 hours  \n- Coordination meetings, tracking: ~8 hours  \n- **Total: ~52 hours over 9 months** (~6 hours/month, manageable within Marcus's portfolio of 25 major prospects)\n\n**Low-cost tactics prioritized:** Coffee meetings, leveraging existing events (Read-a-Thon, Book Fair), volunteer-led site visit, email updates. Only splurge: salon dinner (~$200, shared with other cultivation).",

      "content": "Metro Birth Justice Collective \u2013 Major Donor Cultivation Strategy Plan\n\n**Prepared by:** Naomi Ruiz, Director of Development\n**Reviewed by:** Dr. Carla Nguyen, Executive Director\n\n---\n\n**1) Prospect Snapshot: Kline Family Fund (DAF at Chicago Community Trust)**\n\n*   **Annual Giving Capacity:** $1M+ annually, with significant history of six-figure gifts.\n*   **Giving History (Theirs):** Consistent support for maternal health initiatives, community health worker programs, and equitable healthcare access. Known for multi-year commitments to organizations demonstrating clear measurable impact. Recent grants include six-figure gifts to organizations focused on perinatal mental health and reproductive justice.\n*   **Affinity Indicators:** Public statements from family representatives emphasize a commitment to Chicago-specific health disparities, particularly in underserved communities. Their website highlights interest in innovative models that integrate community voices into healthcare solutions.\n*   **Prior Giving (Ours/Others):** No direct prior giving to Metro Birth Justice Collective. Historically supported similar organizations in Chicago with smaller grants ($25k-$50k) that focus on direct service. Our ask represents a significant step up, aligning with their larger strategic investments.\n*   **Decision-Making Process:** Typically involves initial review by program officers at Chicago Community Trust (CCT), followed by an invitation for a formal proposal to the family trustees. Family engagement often follows CCT's due diligence, with a preference for direct interaction with leaders and beneficiaries before final decisions. Value evidence-based models and sustainability plans.\n*   **Known Connectors:**\n    *   **External:** Sarah Chen (Program Officer, Health & Wellness, Chicago Community Trust), Dr. Lena Brooks (OB-GYN, volunteer with MBJC, and known to Kline family via philanthropic circles).\n    *   **Internal:** Dr. Carla Nguyen (ED, has presented at CCT forums where Kline representatives were present).\n*   **Preferred Communication:** Formal proposals, detailed impact reports, and in-person meetings. Responsive to personalized, data-driven communications.\n\n**2) Cultivation Goal & Case**\n\n*   **Cultivation Goal:** Secure a multi-year commitment of $250,000\u2013$400,000 from the Kline Family Fund within 12 months for the Scaling the Neighborhood Birth Equity Initiative.\n*   **Case for Support:** The Neighborhood Birth Equity Initiative is a proven, community-led model addressing critical maternal health disparities on the South Side. Scaling to three additional hospitals will directly impact thousands of birthing people and newborns, reducing preterm births, improving birth outcomes, and empowering families through culturally competent care. This expansion aligns perfectly with the Kline Family Fund's stated priorities in maternal health, community health workers, and Chicago-specific health equity. Their investment will catalyze systemic change by embedding our successful model into established healthcare systems.\n\n**3) Strategy & Timeline (12 Months)**\n\n*   **Overall Strategy:** Build trust and demonstrate impact through a series of focused, value-driven touchpoints. Leverage CCT as a conduit and Dr. Brooks as an advocate. Position MBJC as the leading expert and implementation partner for birth equity on the South Side. Frame the ask around catalytic funding for sustainable change.\n*   **Key Dates:**\n    *   **March 5:** Board Meeting\n    *   **April 22:** Policy & Practice Forum (MBJC event)\n    *   **June 11:** Board Meeting\n    *   **Sept 14:** Community Partner Salon (MBJC event)\n    *   **Oct 2:** Board Meeting\n    *   **Dec 31:** Fiscal Year-End\n\n**4) Touchpoint Plan (5-8 Meaningful Touches)**\n\n| Touch # | Objective                                                 | Donor Value                                                                                                        | Format                             | Owner                      | Date Window               | Materials                      | Qualification Question                                       |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Initiate connection, gauge interest, understand priorities. | Insight into emerging maternal health needs in Chicago; opportunity to assess alignment.                             | Introductory Call/Virtual Meeting  | Naomi Ruiz                 | Early March                 | MBJC One-Pager, CCT Contact Notes | \"What current healthcare disparities in Chicago are most pressing for the Kline Family?\" |\n| 2       | Connect impact to values; showcase program in action.     | First-hand observation of powerful, community-centric care.                                                         | Site Visit with Program Lead       | ED (Dr. Nguyen), Program Lead | Late April (post-Forum)   | Program Brief, Impact Metrics  | \"How do you assess programmatic impact and scalability for initiatives you support?\" |\n| 3       | Deepen engagement, showcase thought leadership, offer insider perspective. | Exclusive participation in a critical discussion with policy makers and community leaders.                      | Policy & Practice Forum (April 22) (Invite as VIP) | ED (Dr. Nguyen)            | April 22                    | Forum Agenda, MBJC Annual Report | \"What are your greatest hopes for policy changes that can advance health equity?\" |\n| 4       | Provide deep dive into financial sustainability and future vision. | Understanding of systemic change theory and long-term impact.

Readiness is achieved when the prospect has a clear understanding of our impact, trust in our leadership, and a desire to see this initiative succeed.\n\n**6) Roles & Coordination**\n\n*   **Naomi Ruiz (Director of Development):** Owns relationship management, all scheduling, preparing briefing notes, follow-up, and drafting proposal. Primary point of contact. Coordinates with CCT program officer.\n*   **Dr. Carla Nguyen (Executive Director):** Joins Touch 2 (Site Visit), Touch 3 (Policy & Practice Forum), and Touch 4 (Meeting with ED + Financials). Provides strategic vision and programmatic expertise. Prepared with an inspiring 3-minute story of impact.\n*   **Brenda Lee (Board Development Chair):** Hosts Touch 5 (Small Salon) in Q3. Leverages her peer networks and personal connection to the family or CCT. Receives clear briefing notes and talking points from Naomi.\n*   **Dr. Lena Brooks (Volunteer Ambassador):** Provides introductions early in the process (Touch 1). Offers credibility and acts as a trusted peer if necessary, potentially joining a later touchpoint (e.g., Touch 5) if appropriate and agreed upon. Briefed by Naomi on MBJC\u2019s goals and the Kline Fund\u2019s interest.\n*   **Coordination:**\n    *   **Briefing Notes:** Naomi will prepare comprehensive briefing notes for ED, Board, and Dr. Brooks 72 hours prior to each touch, outlining objectives, Kline Fund's history/interests, and talking points/questions.\n    *   **Follow-up:** Naomi will document all touchpoints in Salesforce within 48 hours and send personalized follow-up notes/materials.\n\n**7) Risks/Contingencies**\n\n*   **Risk:** Kline Family Fund remains hesitant about a significant first-time gift.\n    *   **Contingency:** Adjust initial ask to a lower six-figure amount ($100K-$150K) for a pilot phase of the scaling initiative, demonstrating success over\n        1-2 years before a larger ask. Reiterate long-term impact.\n*   **Risk:** Chicago Community Trust program officer is not responsive or presents hurdles.\n    *   **Contingency:** Leverage Dr. Brooks's existing connections within the philanthropic community to inquire about best practices for engaging CCT-managed DAFs. Request a direct meeting with the Kline family if CCT is a bottleneck.\n*   **Risk:** Competing priorities for the Kline Family Fund (e.g., new national initiative).\n    *   **Contingency:** Emphasize the unique, hyper-local impact on a specific Chicago community that MBJC provides, differentiating us from national organizations. Highlight our data-driven success on the South Side.\n\n**8) Tracking & Next Steps**\n\n*   **Tracking System:** Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud.\n*   **Fields to Update:**\n    *   `Opportunity Name`: Kline Family Fund - Neighborhood Birth Equity Initiative.\n    *   `Stage`: Prospecting, Qualification, Cultivation (Current), Stewardship, Ask, Negotiation, Closed Won/Lost.\n    *   `Next Step`: Specific action and due date after each touch.\n    *   `Last Touch Date`.\n    *   `Key Contact Roles`: List Kline family decision-makers and CCT program officer.\n    *   `Interest Areas`: Populate with specific maternal health and CHW affinities.\n    *   `Notes`: Detailed notes from each interaction.\n*   **Simple Metrics:** Number of meaningful touches completed, engagement signal checklist (yes/no), readiness score (1-5).\n*   **Next Steps (Immediate):**\n    1.  Naomi: Draft introductory call script and email for CCT Program Officer (Sarah Chen) by March 1.\n    2.  Naomi: Schedule introductory call (Touch 1) with Kline representative/CCT by mid-March.\n    3.  Naomi: Brief Dr. Brooks on cultivation plan and request assistance with CCT introduction.\n\n**9) Draft Ask Path & Natural Moment**\n\n*   **Framing for $250,000\u2013$400,000:** \"With an investment of $250,000 to $400,000 over three years, your partnership will enable Metro Birth Justice Collective to scale the Neighborhood Birth Equity Initiative to three additional South Side hospitals. This expansion will directly serve an estimated 1,500 birthing people annually, leading to a projected 15% reduction in preterm births and significant improvements in maternal and infant health outcomes in these high-need communities.\"\n*   **Designation Options:**\n    1.  **Core Program Expansion:** $350,000-$400,000 for full program implementation across all three sites, including CHW salaries, training, and program coordination.\n    2.  **Strategic Innovation Fund:** $250,000-$300,000 to pilot specific components of the expansion (e.g., enhanced digital health integration or a specialized perinatal mental health component) across two hospitals, with the goal of demonstrating proof of concept for future scaling.\n    3.  **Capacity Building & Evaluation:** $250,000 for critical infrastructure to support rapid growth (e.g., data systems, enhanced training for new hospital partners, robust evaluation metrics).\n*   **Likely Objections & Responses:**\n    *   *\"This is a large first-time gift for us.\"* \"We understand, and we appreciate your careful approach. Our proposal outlines clear phased milestones and measurable impact, allowing your investment to build on demonstrated success and scale responsibly.\"\n    *   *\"We typically prefer direct service, not infrastructure.\"* \"While our proposal includes essential infrastructure for scalability, the core of this investment is direct service: empowering more birthing people with the community health worker support proven to save lives and improve health outcomes.\"\n    *   *\"How will this integrate with existing hospital services?\"* \"Our initiative is designed for seamless integration. We embed our trained community health workers directly into hospital care teams, collaborating with existing staff to provide holistic, culturally-competent care that complements, rather than duplicates, current services. We have strong MOUs in place with our current hospital partners.\"\n*   **Natural Ask Moment:** Following **Touch 6 (Follow-up Meeting/Call with Naomi/ED)**, likely in mid-November, after they've had an opportunity to review the draft proposal outline and provided initial feedback. This moment allows for a personalized, responsive ask that directly addresses their interests and potential questions identified in earlier touches. The ask could also naturally happen at the end of the **Board Dev Chair-Hosted Small Salon (Touch 5)** if the engagement is exceptionally strong and a clear interest in a larger investment is expressed.",

In fact, community science is integral to the program\u2014volunteer monitors generate the data that drives restoration decisions. We can tailor the designation to reflect your priorities, whether that's 60/40 restoration/education or a different split.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Natural Ask Moment**\n\n**Optimal Timing:** October 12 Oceans Gala VIP reception + follow-up solicitation meeting within 10 days.\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- Gala provides peer energy, program visibility, and celebratory environment.  \n- Ravi will have experienced 6 substantive touches (including lab tour, peer dinner, site visit, and proposal preview).  \n- Timing aligns with Sept 30 fiscal year-end (organizational milestone) and November kelp season (program urgency).  \n- Marina Chen and James Holloway presence signals organizational priority and leadership commitment.  \n- Pre-Gala VIP reception allows private, high-touch setting for ask delivery; follow-up meeting provides space for questions and negotiation.\n\n**Ask Script (Marina Chen, with James Holloway present):**  \n*\"Ravi, over the past months, Sophia, Dr. Tanaka, James, and I have loved seeing your engagement with the Blue Carbon program\u2014from the dive site to the lab to tonight's celebration. Your insights have shaped our thinking, and it's clear this work resonates with your values and your vision for scalable climate solutions. We'd like to invite you and Anjali to anchor this program with a $5 million investment over five years\u2014the Narayanan Blue Carbon Leadership Fund. This would establish kelp restoration as a cornerstone of California's climate strategy and position you as a founding leader in blue carbon innovation. Can we walk you through the options and explore what feels right for your family?\"*\n\n---\n\n**End of Plan**",

        "reasoning": "This is an exceptionally strong cultivation plan that demonstrates sophisticated major gifts practice. It's board-ready, strategically sequenced, and highly actionable. The formal tone is pitch-perfect, touchpoints are substantive and donor-centered, and the level of detail (qualification questions, time estimates, CRM fields) makes it immediately usable by a development team.",
        "strengths": [
          "Outstanding touchpoint design: each interaction has clear objective, donor value proposition, specific qualification question, and realistic time estimate\u2014avoids generic 'check-ins' entirely",
          "Excellent strategic sequencing: moves logically from relationship-building (coffee, site visit) through peer validation and scientific depth to co-creation (advisory role, proposal preview) before the ask",
          "Sophisticated stakeholder choreography: CEO and board member are deployed at precisely the right moments with clear briefing protocols and follow-up responsibilities",
          "Donor-centered framing throughout: capacity-aware ask structures, multiple designation options, objection handling that validates concerns while advancing the case",
          "Highly actionable tracking section: specific CRM fields, simple metrics, and concrete next steps with dates make this immediately implementable",
          "Strong risk mitigation: identifies realistic obstacles (spouse engagement, market volatility, competing priorities) with practical contingencies",
          "Natural ask moment is well-justified and tied to specific event with clear rationale for timing and participants",
          "Formal tone executed flawlessly: precise language, board-ready formatting, no jargon or clich\u00e9s, appropriate for $2.5M-$5M solicitation"

        "weaknesses": [
          "Minor authenticity concern: some phrasing feels slightly templated (e.g., 'co-design discussion,' 'catalytic investment') though still professional and appropriate for the context",
          "Touch 8 labeled 'conditional' but lacks clear decision criteria for whether to deploy it\u2014could specify triggers more precisely",
          "Qualification questions are uniformly strong but occasionally feel slightly formulaic in construction\u2014a few could be more conversational while retaining substance"
