Her hands, once unsure, now moved with confidence\u2014a testament to the growth cultivated not just in the soil, but within herself.\n\n**Story/Context**\n\nAt Southside Fresh Collective, we grow youth leadership and neighborhood health through community agriculture and micro-enterprise. Our Block-to-Table Youth Market, a pilot program from January to June 2025, engaged 42 teens aged 14\u201318 from low-income households in Milwaukee\u2019s 53204 and 53215 ZIP codes. This cohort reflected our community's vibrant diversity: 78% Latino/a, 12% Black, and 10% other/multiracial youth.\n\n**What Changed (Numbers)**\n\nOver six months, these young people transformed statistics into tangible impact.\n\n*   **Financial Futures Blossom:** All 42 apprentices completed an 80-hour paid training, learning vital financial management skills. A remarkable 86% increased their financial literacy scores by 20 points or more, significantly exceeding our initial goal and the 61% improvement seen in our 2024 cohort (which had 28 apprentices). Their average financial literacy score jumped from a pre-program 56/100 to an impressive 78/100 post-program.\n*   **Harvesting Health, Nourishing Neighbors:** Our youth harvested and distributed 18,400 pounds of fresh produce\u2014a substantial increase over the 12,300 pounds from 2024. This volume is equivalent to providing two servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to every single student in all of Milwaukee's South Division High School for three weeks!\n*   **Professional Pathways Power Up:** An impressive 72% of our apprentices earned their ServSafe food-handler certification, a nationally recognized credential that opens doors to employment in the food service industry. This marks a positive leap from the 55% certification rate in the previous year.\n\n**What It Means**\n\nBeyond the numbers, we witnessed profound human impact. Youth reported stronger relationships with adult mentors and a palpable increase in confidence when speaking with customers at the market. Neighborhood elders noted increased foot traffic and a wider array of fresh options at the Saturday market, fostering a renewed sense of community connection. As Jazmine R. shared, \"I used to be shy, but now I love talking about the vegetables we grew. It feels good to see people happy to get healthy food.\"\n\nThese results matter deeply for youth employment and healthy food access on Milwaukee\u2019s South Side. We saw remarkable progress in empowering youth with practical skills and financial knowledge, exceeding our financial literacy and harvest goals. We were especially pleased with the high rate of ServSafe certifications, truly preparing these teens for future job opportunities. While some weather-related delays affected specific crop yields, our overall harvest still showed significant growth, demonstrating resilience and effective planning.\n\n**How We Measured**\n\nWe meticulously tracked our progress using attendance logs, pre/post financial literacy quizzes, point-of-sale data, and harvest logs. Youth surveys offered valuable qualitative insights. All data was pulled from our Apricot case management system and cross-checked by program staff to ensure accuracy. We acknowledge this was a small pilot sample with no control group, and some self-reported measures may include response bias.\n\n**Proposed Visual**\n\n**Chart Title: Growth in Action: Comparing Youth Impact (2024 vs. 2025)**\n*Horizontal Bar Chart*\n*Y-axis (Categories): Financial Literacy Gain (\u226520 pts), Produce Harvested (lbs), ServSafe Certification (%)*\n*X-axis (Values): Percentage/Pounds*\n*Bars (grouped by category): 2024 (lighter shade), 2025 (darker shade)*\n\n*Data points:*\n*Financial Literacy Gain: 2024 = 61%, 2025 = 86%*\n*Produce Harvested: 2024 = 12,300 lbs, 2025 = 18,400 lbs*\n*ServSafe Certification: 2024 = 55%, 2025 = 72%*\n\n*Caption: This chart illustrates the significant increase in participant success and community benefit from the 2024 to 2025 Block-to-Table Youth Market pilot seasons.*\n\n**What\u2019s Next**\n\nWe are committed to building on this success, expanding opportunities for youth, and delivering even more fresh produce to our community. You can join us in nurturing these future leaders and fostering a healthier South Side. Sponsor one youth stipend at $50/week for our upcoming fall cohort, or volunteer for a two-hour Saturday market shift to connect directly with the youth and their amazing work. This fall, we plan to implement a mentorship component with local small business owners, further strengthening the entrepreneurial skills of our apprentices and deepening their ties to the neighborhood economy.\n\nBy Marisol Vega, Program Director, Southside Fresh Collective",

      "content": "# From Harvest to Hope: How 42 Young Leaders Are Reshaping Milwaukee's South Side\n\n**Story / Context**\n\nOn a Saturday morning in May, Jazmine R. stood behind a folding table stacked with tomatoes, radishes, and Swiss chard\u2014produce she'd planted, tended, and priced herself. \"I used to walk past farmers' markets thinking they weren't for people like me,\" she told us. \"Now I'm running one.\"\n\nJazmine is one of 42 young people who joined our Block-to-Table Youth Market pilot this past spring. From January through June 2025, teens ages 14\u201318 from Milwaukee's South Side neighborhoods (ZIP codes 53204 and 53215) worked alongside us at Southside Fresh Collective, where we grow youth leadership and neighborhood health through community agriculture and micro-enterprise. Seventy-eight percent of our apprentices identify as Latino/a, 12 percent as Black, and 10 percent as other or multiracial; all come from low-income households.\n\n---\n\n**What Changed (Numbers)**\n\nThis season, we saw measurable shifts in both skills and systems:\n\n- **42 apprentices completed an 80-hour paid training**\u2014up from 28 in our 2024 baseline season, a 50 percent increase that filled every Saturday market shift and two new greenhouse rotations.\n\n- **86 percent increased their financial literacy scores by at least 20 points** (average pre-program score: 56 out of 100; post-program: 78)\u2014a sharp jump from 61 percent in 2024. To put that in perspective, the average gain equals learning to budget a monthly paycheck, calculate sales tax, and understand a simple W-2.\n\n- **18,400 pounds of produce harvested and distributed**\u2014equivalent to fresh vegetables for every student at South Division High School for two weeks. That's 6,100 pounds more than last year.\n\n- **72 percent earned ServSafe food-handler certification**, up from 55 percent, meaning 30 young people now hold a credential recognized by restaurants and grocers across Wisconsin.\n\nYouth reported stronger relationships with adult mentors and greater confidence speaking with customers. Neighborhood elders noted increased foot traffic and more fresh options at the Saturday market.\n\n---\n\n**What It Means**\n\nThese numbers tell us that paid, hands-on work builds both financial capability and civic trust. The 20-point literacy gain matters because it moves young people from \"I don't know how to save\" to \"I opened my first savings account\"\u2014a threshold linked to long-term economic stability. The jump in produce volume means more families in 53204 and 53215 accessed fresh food within walking distance, addressing a persistent gap in healthy food access on Milwaukee's South Side.\n\nWe exceeded our goals for apprentice enrollment and certification, but weather-related delays in April meant we fell short of our 20,000-pound harvest target. That gap reminds us how climate variability affects both our yields and our young workers' earning potential.\n\n---\n\n**How We Measured**\n\nWe tracked progress through attendance logs, pre- and post-program financial literacy quizzes, point-of-sale and harvest logs, and youth surveys. All data were pulled from our Apricot case management system and cross-checked by program staff. \n\nA few honest caveats: This was a small pilot without a control group. Weather delays affected crop yield, and some measures\u2014like confidence and relationships\u2014rely on self-reporting, which may include response bias. Still, the patterns are clear and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**What's Next**\n\nWe're expanding to a fall cohort of 50 apprentices and adding a winter greenhouse track. To make that happen, we need neighbors, small business owners, and individual donors to join us:\n\n- **Sponsor one youth stipend** at $50 per week for the fall cohort (12 weeks = $600).\n- **Volunteer for a two-hour Saturday market shift** starting in September.\n- **Share this story** with a local business that hires teens or sources locally.\n\nWhen young people like Jazmine see themselves as growers, earners, and neighbors, everyone's table gets a little fuller.\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Visual:**\n\n**Chart type:** Side-by-side bar chart  \n**Title:** \"Youth Outcomes Grew Alongside the Harvest: 2024 vs. 2025\"  \n**Y-axis:** Percentage or count  \n**X-axis:** Four categories\u2014Apprentices Enrolled | Financial Literacy Gains (\u226520 pts) | Pounds Harvested | ServSafe Certified  \n**Data points:** 2024 bars (28 | 61% | 12,300 | 55%) and 2025 bars (42 | 86% | 18,400 | 72%)  \n**Caption:** \"In our second season, more young people gained real skills\u2014and our South Side neighbors gained thousands more pounds of fresh food.\"\n\n---\n\n*By Marisol Vega, Program Director*  \n*Southside Fresh Collective*",

[BENEFICIARY PROFILE: Youth apprentice at Block-to-Table Youth Market, Milwaukee South Side; STORY CONSENT: Written consent from youth and guardian (05/2025); first name and last initial used; no sensitive details]\nWe grow youth leadership and neighborhood health through community agriculture and micro-enterprise. In our January\u2013June 2025 pilot season, we engaged 42 teens (ages 14\u201318) from low-income households\u201478% Latino/a; 12% Black; 10% other/multiracial\u2014across Milwaukee\u2019s South Side (ZIPs 53204 and 53215).\n\nWhat Changed (Numbers)\n- 42 youth apprentices completed an 80-hour paid training (2024: 28). That is two full work weeks per teen\u20143,360 total youth-paid learning hours.\n- Financial literacy gains: 86% (36 of 42) increased their scores by at least 20 points (2024: 61%). Average pre-program score rose from 56/100 to 78/100.\n- Food access: 18,400 pounds of produce were harvested and distributed (2024: 12,300). That\u2019s roughly 55,000 servings of fruits and vegetables.\n- Food safety: 72% (30 of 42) earned ServSafe food-handler certification (2024: 55%).\nRelatable equivalents\n- 18,400 pounds is about 9 tons\u2014enough for approximately 55,000 produce servings at the Saturday market.\n- 80 hours per youth equals two full-time work weeks, building real workplace habits and paychecks.\n\nWhat It Means\nThese results matter because first jobs\u2014and the skills to manage a paycheck\u2014set the foundation for lifetime earning, while affordable produce strengthens neighborhood health. We exceeded expectations in both scale and depth: more teens participated, and their average financial literacy jumped 22 points, suggesting that paid practice at the market reinforces classroom lessons. Youth also reported stronger relationships with adult mentors and greater confidence speaking with customers. Neighborhood elders noted increased foot traffic and more fresh options on Saturdays\u2014a sign the market is becoming a trusted, local source.\nProgress still to make: while ServSafe certifications improved to 72%, we want to reach at least 80% next season so more youth can qualify for higher-wage food jobs. Weather-related delays trimmed early harvests, reminding us to invest in season extension and backup sourcing.\nJazmine R. reflected, \u201cI used to get nervous talking to people. Now I can greet customers, explain prices, and make change. It feels like I\u2019m part of the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nHow We Measured\nWe tracked attendance, training hours, and certifications through program attendance logs; financial learning through pre/post quizzes; produce and sales through harvest and point-of-sale logs; and youth experience via surveys. All data were pulled from Apricot case management and cross-checked by program staff. Limitations: this was a small pilot with no control group; weather affected yields; and some self-reported items may include response bias.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n- For neighbors: Shop the Block-to-Table Youth Market or volunteer for a two-hour Saturday shift to greet customers and bag produce.\n- For small businesses: Host a one-day pop-up or mentor a teen on customer service basics.\n- For donors under $1,000: Sponsor one youth stipend at $50/week for the fall cohort or underwrite ServSafe exam fees for two apprentices ($85 each).\nPlanned improvements for fall: expand to 50\u201360 apprentices, add weekday farmstand hours in 53204 and 53215, and offer targeted ServSafe tutoring to reach an 80% pass rate. With your partnership, we can grow first jobs that pay, skills that stick, and fresh food that stays local.\n\nSuggested visual\nTitle: 2024 vs. 2025 Pilot\u2014Youth Skills and Food Access\nAxes: X-axis = Metric; Y-axis = Count or Percent\nData points: Apprentices (2024: 28; 2025: 42); Financial Literacy +20 points (2024: 61%; 2025: 86%); Produce (2024: 12,300 lb; 2025: 18,400 lb); ServSafe (2024: 55%; 2025: 72%)\nCaption: The 2025 pilot grew both participation and outcomes across all key measures.\n\nBy Marisol Vega, Program Director, Southside Fresh Collective.",

      "content": "## Bridging the Distance to Healing: Hope on the High Plains\n\n**Story/Context**\n\nWhen \"Lily\" needed to talk to someone, the nearest clinic was a two-hour drive across challenging rural roads\u2014a journey practically impossible with limited transportation and a busy family schedule. Lily's story reflects the reality for many in Western South Dakota, where mental health care feels out of reach. We believe everyone deserves timely, affordable mental health care, especially in rural communities. Through our TeleTherapy Access Network (TAN) across seven frontier counties (Butte, Harding, Meade, Perkins, Corson, Dewey, Ziebach), we are making that belief a reality for adolescents and adults ages 12 and up. From July 2024 to May 2025, our clients included 42% Native American and 58% non-Native individuals, encompassing both uninsured and Medicaid recipients.\n\n**What Changed (Numbers)**\n\nOur TAN program has significantly expanded access to vital mental health services. This fiscal year (FY2025), we proudly served 612 clients \u2014 an entire Sturgis Brown High School worth of individuals \u2014 who completed four or more teletherapy sessions. This is a dramatic increase from the 355 clients served in FY2024. More importantly, the median wait time for an initial appointment plummeted from 28 days in FY2024 to just 9 days this year, meaning individuals receive support when they need it most. We also saw substantial improvements in mental well-being: 64% of clients showed a clinically significant reduction in depression symptoms (a \u22655-point PHQ-9 depression score reduction), compared to 41% last year. The average baseline PHQ-9 score for our FY2025 cohort was 14.1, reducing to 8.2 by their latest assessment, indicating a shift from moderate to mild depression. Client engagement also soared, with 71% remaining in treatment for at least eight weeks, an increase from 52% in FY2024.\n\n**What It Means**\n\nThese numbers represent reduced suffering and increased capacity for individuals to lead healthier lives. The significant reduction in wait times means that a person experiencing a mental health crisis can now begin therapy before their symptoms escalate further. The improved retention rates suggest that clients are finding value and consistency in their care. The privacy afforded by telehealth in community spaces, like library rooms, was a consistent theme in client feedback, with one stating it allowed them to address their mental health without fear of judgment. Ranch hands, in particular, appreciated evening appointments, allowing them to prioritize their well-being without disrupting critical work during calving season. As Tanya White Eagle, Community Health Worker in the Cheyenne River area, shared, \"Having this option means people don't have to choose between their job, their family, and their mental health. It\u2019s making a real difference in people's daily lives here.\" Our progress on depression symptom reduction exceeded expectations, especially given the complex needs of a rural, often underserved population. While we celebrate these successes, we acknowledge that expanding reach to even more clients remains an ongoing goal.\n\n**How We Measured**\n\nOur data is rigorously collected and analyzed, ensuring reliable insights into our program's effectiveness. We utilize de-identified electronic health record extracts from Athenahealth, coupled with standardized PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7 (anxiety) screenings administered at intake and every four sessions. Scheduling system timestamps provide accurate wait time data. All data is analyzed in R, and our work operates under an IRB exemption determination. We recognize that follow-up screenings were not completed by 18% of clients, and variable broadband access occasionally limited video sessions for some. Additionally, we do not have a randomized comparison group, which is a common limitation in community-based program evaluations.\n\n**What\u2019s Next**\n\nWe are committed to building on this momentum. The impact of the TAN program on rural mental health access and suicide prevention is profound, bringing essential care to areas where it was once scarcely available.\n\n**Visual Suggestion:**\n\n**Title: Faster Access, Better Outcomes: TeleTherapy's Impact**\n\n**(Bar Chart)**\n**Y-axis:** Metric (e.g., Wait Time in Days, % Clients with PHQ-9 Reduction)\n**X-axis:** Fiscal Year (FY2024, FY2025)\n**Data Points:**\n*   Median Wait Time FY24: 28 days; Median Wait Time FY25: 9 days\n*   % Clients with \u22655-point PHQ-9 Reduction FY24: 41%; % Clients with \u22655-point PHQ-9 Reduction FY25: 64%\n*   8-Week Retention FY24: 52%; 8-Week Retention FY25: 71%\n\n**Caption:** This chart illustrates the dramatic improvements in client access, symptom reduction, and treatment retention achieved by the TeleTherapy Access Network from FY2024 to FY2025.\n\nTo further amplify our impact, we invite family foundations, community health trusts, and regional corporate partners to support our next steps. For example, your contribution could fund 50 data-enabled tablets at $120 each, allowing us to reach clients without personal devices and bridge the digital divide.\n\nBy Dr. Lena McAdams, Director of Impact and Evaluation, High Plains Behavioral Health Alliance.",

Instead, nine days later, she met her licensed therapist via secure video\u2014using a private room at her town's public library. [BENEFICIARY PROFILE/NAME; STORY CONSENT: Parental and youth verbal consent documented (03/2025); pseudonym used; non-identifying details only.]\n\nMaya is one of 612 people\u2014adolescents and adults ages 12 and older\u2014who completed four or more teletherapy sessions through the TeleTherapy Access Network (TAN), our program serving seven frontier counties in Western South Dakota: Butte, Harding, Meade, Perkins, Corson, Dewey, and Ziebach. Forty-two percent of clients identify as Native American; 58% as non-Native; many are uninsured or rely on Medicaid. **We expand timely, affordable mental health care across rural communities.** This narrative reports outcomes from fiscal year 2025 to date (July 2024\u2013May 2025).\n\n---\n\n## What Changed (Numbers)\n\nCompared to FY2024, when we served 355 clients, we nearly doubled participation to **612 people who completed four or more teletherapy sessions**\u2014the equivalent of every resident in the town of Lemmon, South Dakota.\n\n**Wait times fell sharply.** Median time from intake to first appointment dropped from 28 days in FY2024 to **9 days in FY2025**\u2014three weeks faster.\n\n**Depression symptoms improved meaningfully.** Sixty-four percent of clients achieved at least a 5-point reduction on the PHQ-9 depression screen, up from 41 percent last year. Across the FY2025 cohort, **average PHQ-9 scores fell from 14.1 (moderate depression) to 8.2 (mild symptoms)**\u2014a clinically significant decrease.\n\n**More people stayed engaged.** Seventy-one percent of clients remained in care at eight weeks, compared to 52 percent in FY2024\u2014a 19-percentage-point increase in retention.\n\nClients cited **privacy and reduced stigma using telehealth rooms at libraries**; ranch hands appreciated **evening appointments during calving season**. As Tanya White Eagle, Community Health Worker in the Cheyenne River area, put it: *\"Folks don't have to explain why they're driving two hours to see a therapist. They can get care without the whole county knowing.\"* (Quoted with consent.)\n\n---\n\n## What It Means\n\nIn frontier counties where the nearest mental health provider can be three hours away and suicide rates exceed the national average, **shortening wait times and keeping people in treatment saves lives.** The jump from 41 to 64 percent of clients achieving depression relief suggests that consistent, convenient care works\u2014when barriers of distance, time, and visibility are removed.\n\nStill, **we exceeded expectations on access but recognize retention remains fragile**: 18 percent of clients did not complete follow-up screenings, and variable broadband limited video quality for some. We saw no randomized comparison group, so external factors\u2014seasonal employment, policy changes\u2014may influence results.\n\n---\n\n## How We Measured\n\nWe drew **de-identified electronic health record extracts (Athenahealth), standardized PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screenings at intake and every four sessions, and scheduling system timestamps**; data were analyzed in R under an IRB exemption determination. Limitations include incomplete follow-up screenings for 18 percent of clients, inconsistent broadband connectivity that forced some sessions to audio-only, and the absence of a randomized control group.\n\n---\n\n## What's Next\n\nTo reach more people like Maya and sustain these gains, we invite **family foundations, community health trusts, and regional corporate partners** to:\n\n- **Fund 50 data-enabled tablets at $120 each** ($6,000 total) to reach clients without reliable devices.\n- **Underwrite travel stipends** for in-person psychiatric referrals when teletherapy alone isn't sufficient.\n\nWe're piloting peer navigator support to boost retention and integrating live chat intake to cut wait times further.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggested Visual**\n\n**Chart type:** Clustered bar chart  \n**Title:** Median Wait Time and 8-Week Retention, FY2024 vs. FY2025  \n**X-axis:** Metric (Wait Time in Days | Retention %)  \n**Y-axis:** Value  \n**Data points:**  \n- Wait Time: FY2024 = 28 days; FY2025 = 9 days  \n- Retention: FY2024 = 52%; FY2025 = 71%  \n**Caption:** Faster access and stronger engagement: clients in FY2025 waited three weeks less and were 19 percentage points more likely to stay in care.\n\n---\n\n*By Dr. Lena McAdams, Director of Impact and Evaluation*  \n*High Plains Behavioral Health Alliance*\n\n---\n\n**Word count:** 547",

Two months later, he tells us he \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel alone\u201d and keeps his weekly sessions.\n\nThrough our TeleTherapy Access Network (TAN) in Western South Dakota\u2014serving seven frontier counties (Butte, Harding, Meade, Perkins, Corson, Dewey, Ziebach)\u2014we expand timely, affordable mental health care across rural communities. FY2025 to date (July 2024\u2013May 2025), TAN supported adolescents and adults ages 12+, with clients identifying as 42% Native American and 58% non-Native; a mix of uninsured and Medicaid.\n\nWhat Changed (Numbers)\n- Access grew: 612 clients completed 4+ teletherapy sessions in FY2025 to date, up from 355 in FY2024. That\u2019s enough people to fill about 12 standard 50-seat school buses.\n- Faster starts: Median wait time dropped to 9 days from referral to first appointment (down from 28 days in FY2024)\u2014nearly three weeks earlier care.\n- Symptom improvement: 64% of clients experienced a 5+ point reduction on the PHQ-9 depression scale (vs. 41% in FY2024). Within the FY2025 cohort, average PHQ-9 moved from 14.1 at intake to 8.2 at latest\u2014on average, a shift from moderate toward mild depression.\n- Staying engaged: 71% were retained at 8 weeks (\u22654 sessions), compared with 52% last year\u2014about 7 out of every 10 neighbors stayed with care.\n\nRelatable context: 612 clients is roughly the number of people served in a busy county clinic month; a 19-day faster start means first help comes almost three weeks sooner, which matters in crisis-prone seasons.\n\nQualitative insights: Clients cited privacy and reduced stigma when using telehealth rooms at libraries; ranch hands appreciated evening appointments during calving season. As Tanya White Eagle, Community Health Worker in the Cheyenne River area, shared (quoted with consent), \u201cWhen counseling is just a secure link away\u2014and there\u2019s a quiet room at the library\u2014people actually come. It fits life out here.\u201d\n\nWhat It Means\nIn frontier counties where winter roads, long distances, and tight budgets delay care, earlier starts and steady engagement are essential for mental health access and suicide prevention. The scale-up from 355 to 612 clients and the improvement in both symptoms and retention exceeded our FY2025 expectations. Progress lagged where broadband was weak and when clients lacked devices, which limited video quality and sometimes led to phone-only sessions. Still, moving the average PHQ-9 from 14.1 to 8.2 suggests many clients are experiencing meaningful relief.\n\nHow We Measured\nWe analyzed de-identified electronic health record extracts (Athenahealth), standardized PHQ-9/GAD-7 screenings at intake and every four sessions, and scheduling system timestamps; analyses were conducted in R with an IRB exemption determination. Limitations: 18% of clients did not complete follow-up screenings, variable broadband limited video for some visits, and we did not use a randomized comparison group.\n\nSimple visual to include\nTitle: TAN Outcomes\u2014FY2024 vs. FY2025 to Date (July 2024\u2013May 2025)\nAxes: X-axis = Metric (Clients Served, Median Wait Days, PHQ-9 \u22655-pt Improvement %, 8-week Retention %); Y-axis = Value\nData points: FY2024\u2014Clients 355; Wait 28; PHQ-9 Improvement 41%; Retention 52%.

Immediate opportunity: Fund 50 data-enabled tablets at $120 each to reach clients without devices, and underwrite 100 travel stipends at $40 each for in-person referrals when teletherapy indicates higher-acuity care. Next, we will deepen evening and weekend coverage through calving and harvest seasons and report subgroup outcomes to ensure equitable progress for Native and non-Native clients.\n\nBy Dr. Lena McAdams, Director of Impact and Evaluation, High Plains Behavioral Health Alliance.",

Now, her son's attendance has stabilized, and her daughter is thriving in after-school programs. Maria's story, and countless others like hers, is at the heart of our mission.\n\nAt Pacific Shelter & Housing Partnership, we end homelessness by pairing housing with tailored supports. Our Keys to Home Rapid Rehousing program, operating in King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties, actively works to connect individuals and families with stable homes. In Calendar Year 2024, our program served a diverse population exiting homelessness, with 38% identifying as Black/African American, 22% Latinx, 14% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 9% Native American/Alaska Native. Notably, 41% of our participants were individuals with a disability, reflecting our commitment to serving those most vulnerable. We provided follow-up services through September 2025 for these households.\n\n**What Changed (Numbers)**\n\nThis past year, we celebrated significant strides in our Keys to Home program. We successfully moved 1,284 households into stable housing within 90 days of enrollment. To put this in perspective, that's nearly two high schools\u2019 worth of lives transformed \u2013 individuals, couples, and families \u2013 finding the security of home. Our retention rates are strong: 88% of these households remained housed at the 12-month mark. We also significantly reduced the median time it took to secure a lease, dropping to 76 days from when participants entered the program. Furthermore, employment among heads of household saw a positive upward trend, increasing from 31% at intake to 47% at exit.\n\nThese achievements demonstrate substantial improvement compared to Calendar Year 2023, when we housed 1,050 households, achieved an 82% 12-month retention rate, and had a median lease-up time of 96 days. Employment at exit in 2023 was 36%. It's important to recognize that for the 2024 cohort, the average time individuals experienced homelessness before enrolling in our program was 142 days \u2013 making their rapid transition to housing in an average of 76 days an even more remarkable testament to the program\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n**What It Means**\n\nOur success is rooted in strong partnerships. Landlord partners consistently cited our damage-mitigation fund as decisive in their willingness to accept applicants. This fund builds trust and reduces financial risk, opening doors for our participants. The impact on families is profound: parents reported that their children\u2019s school attendance stabilized after moving closer to school and public transit, creating a foundation for educational success. As Alicia M., a program participant, shared, \"Having a safe place to call our own has made all the difference. My kids are sleeping better, and I can finally focus on finding a job.\"\n\n**How We Measured**\n\nOur data is rigorously collected and aligned with industry standards. We obtain Regional Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) exports, adhering to Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definitions. Quarterly file audits ensure data accuracy, and our 6- and 12-month retention rates are verified through follow-up calls, landlord confirmations, and checks against state benefits databases. We are also transparent about our challenges: 9% of households were unreachable at 12 months, and rising rents coupled with voucher processing delays sometimes affected the time it took to secure a lease. We acknowledge that outcomes may vary by county.\n\n**Visual Suggestion:**\n\n**Bar Chart: Keys to Home Program Progress: 2023 vs. 2024**\n\n![Bar Chart Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Bar+Chart+Placeholder)\n*X-axis: Metrics (Households Housed, 12-Month Retention, Median Days to Lease-Up, Employment at Exit)*\n*Y-axis: Values*\n*Bars for CY2023 (e.g., light blue)*\n*Bars for CY2024 (e.g., dark blue)*\n\n*Caption: This chart illustrates the significant improvements in housing outcomes between our 2023 and 2024 program years.*\n\n**What\u2019s Next**\n\nThese results underscore the critical importance of sustained investment in housing solutions. The progress we\u2019ve made in King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties directly translates into fewer individuals and families experiencing the trauma of homelessness and more people contributing to the health and vitality of our communities. Our ability to accelerate rehousing and increase stability while navigating a challenging housing market demonstrates where our strategies are exceeding expectations.\n\nYour support is vital to continuing this momentum. We invite major donors, institutional funders, and workplace-giving leaders to underwrite the Flexible Move-In Fund at $1,500 per household. This fund directly addresses move-in barriers and accelerates housing placement. Alternatively, a multi-year pledge would allow us to stabilize 300 more households, charting a path toward a Puget Sound region where everyone has a place to call home.\n\nBy Naomi K.

That's everything.\"\n\nPacific Shelter & Housing Partnership ends homelessness by pairing housing with tailored supports. Our Keys to Home Rapid Rehousing program operates across King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties in Washington, serving families with children and single adults exiting homelessness. In calendar year 2024, 38% of participants identified as Black or African American, 22% as Latinx, 14% as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 9% as Native American or Alaska Native, and 41% reported living with a disability. The results below reflect exits through September 2025.\n\n**What Changed (Numbers)**\n\nIn 2024, we moved **1,284 households into housing within 90 days**\u2014the equivalent of every household in Bainbridge Island's downtown core, plus two full apartment towers. That's **234 more households than in 2023**, when we served 1,050.\n\n- **88% remained housed at 12 months**, up from 82% in 2023\u2014a gain of 6 percentage points that represents roughly 77 more households maintaining stability a year later.\n- **Median days to lease-up dropped from 96 to 76 days**, cutting wait time by nearly three weeks.\n- **Employment among heads of household rose from 31% at intake to 47% at exit**, compared to 36% in 2023\u2014an 11-point improvement.\n\nFor context: participants experiencing homelessness spent an average of 142 days without stable shelter *before* enrolling\u2014yet we connected them to a lease in just 76 days *after* enrollment, nearly cutting that timeline in half.\n\n**What It Means**\n\nThese gains matter because speed and stability are the foundation of recovery. Faster lease-up means children settle into schools, parents secure jobs, and chronic stress begins to ease. The jump in 12-month retention signals that housing plus tailored supports\u2014flexible financial assistance, employment coaching, case management\u2014can interrupt the cycle of homelessness across the region's most under-resourced communities.\n\nLandlord partners cited our damage-mitigation fund as decisive for accepting applicants with rental histories affected by homelessness. Parents reported that kids' school attendance stabilized after moving close to transit and familiar neighborhoods.\n\nStill, progress was uneven. Rising rents and voucher processing delays stretched time-to-lease in some cases, and 9% of households were unreachable at 12 months despite multiple outreach attempts. Outcomes varied by county, with Pierce showing stronger early retention and King facing tighter rental markets.\n\n**How We Measured**\n\nWe extract data from the Regional Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), aligned to HUD definitions, and conduct quarterly file audits. We verify 6- and 12-month retention through participant calls, landlord confirmation, and cross-checks with state benefits databases. Where contact is lost, we report it.\n\n**What's Next**\n\nWe're expanding our landlord recruitment in Snohomish County and piloting a post-exit employment cohort to sustain income gains beyond program exit.\n\n**Your partnership can accelerate this work:**\n- **Major donors:** Underwrite the Flexible Move-In Fund at $1,500 per household to cover deposits, first month's rent, and damage mitigation.\n- **Institutional funders:** Commit a multi-year pledge to stabilize 300 more households and strengthen our employment navigator capacity.\n- **Workplace-giving leaders:** Sponsor a cohort of 25 households ($37,500) and invite employees to tour housing sites.\n\nEvery day faster matters.

In Calendar Year 2024 (with follow-up through September 2025), we served families with children and single adults exiting homelessness: 38% Black/African American; 22% Latinx; 14% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; 9% Native American/Alaska Native; and 41% living with a disability.\n\nWhat Changed (Numbers)\n- 1,284 households moved into housing within 90 days (up from 1,050 in CY2023).\n- 88% remained housed at 12 months (up from 82% in CY2023)\u2014about nine out of ten neighbors sustaining housing.\n- Median days to lease-up fell to 76 (from 96 in CY2023)\u2014about the length of a school quarter.\n- Employment among heads of household rose from 31% at intake to 47% at exit (vs. 36% at exit in CY2023).\n- Within the 2024 cohort, people were homeless an average of 142 days before enrolling; after enrollment, the median time to lease fell to 76 days\u2014nearly cutting the wait in half.\n\nQualitative insights: Landlord partners told us the damage\u2011mitigation fund was decisive in approving applications. Parents shared that once housed near transit and school, children\u2019s attendance stabilized. As Alicia put it, \u201cHaving a lease changed our routine\u2014now I can say yes to extra shifts and still be there for pickup.\u201d\n\nWhat It Means\nFaster lease-ups and stronger 12\u2011month retention show that pairing rent assistance with tailored supports is working across Puget Sound. The jump in employment at exit signals growing financial stability, which is critical to staying housed in a high-cost market. We also saw progress in enrolling and housing communities disproportionately impacted by homelessness, including Black, Latinx, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Native American/Alaska Native households. Where we lagged: rising rents and voucher processing delays continued to slow time-to-lease in some properties, and county-level market differences shaped outcomes. Still, 2024 outperformed 2023 on every core measure\u2014fewer days to keys, more people stably housed, and more earners at exit.\n\nHow We Measured\nWe use Regional Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) exports aligned with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definitions, conduct quarterly file audits, and verify 6\u2011 and 12\u2011month housing retention through participant calls, landlord confirmation, and checks against state benefits databases. Nine percent of households were unreachable at 12 months. We are transparent that rising rents and voucher processing delays affected some timelines, and results vary by county.\n\nSuggested Visual\nTitle: Keys to Home\u2014Faster, Stronger Results (CY2023 vs. CY2024)\n- X\u2011axis: Year (2023, 2024)\n- Left Y\u2011axis (bars): Households housed (1,050; 1,284) and Median days to lease (96; 76)\n- Right Y\u2011axis (line): 12\u2011month retention (82%; 88%)\nCaption: From 2023 to 2024, Keys to Home housed more households, cut lease-up time, and improved one\u2011year housing stability.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\nTo keep pace with need and shorten time-to-lease further:\n- Major donors: Underwrite the Flexible Move\u2011In Fund at $1,500 per household to secure units fast.\n- Institutional funders: Commit a multi\u2011year pledge to stabilize 300 additional households and expand landlord risk-mitigation in Pierce and Snohomish.\n- Workplace-giving leaders: Sponsor the Employment Bridge so 250 heads of household can connect to jobs during the first 90 days of housing.\nNext, we will deepen landlord partnerships, streamline voucher processing with housing authorities, and scale school\u2011adjacent placements so kids can stay in class and caregivers can sustain work.\n\nBy Naomi K.
