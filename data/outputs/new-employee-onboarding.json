Given our small team and hybrid environment, this plan prioritizes a warm welcome, essential compliance, and role clarity, while also building connections and understanding our mission. Checklist owners: Lila Chen and Jada Williams.\n\n**Pre-Start:** This phase ensures all administrative and technical foundations are laid before the Program Assistant's first day. The goal is to provide a smooth transition, covering essential paperwork, system access, and a warm, personalized welcome, minimizing Day 1 setup.\n\n**Day 1:** The focus of Day 1 is integration and initial orientation. We aim to make the new Program Assistant feel welcomed, provide essential logistical information, and start familiarizing them with their immediate surroundings and team members, without overwhelming them with too much information.\n\n**Week 1 (Days 2\u20135):** This week is dedicated to deeper immersion into our programs, team, and organizational culture. The Program Assistant will begin to understand their role's impact, connect with colleagues, and get hands-on with initial tasks and tools, fostering a sense of belonging and purpose.\n\n**Weeks 2\u20134:** During this period, the Program Assistant will solidify their understanding of daily operations and program specifics. They will engage in targeted training, begin shadowing, and contribute to initial projects, building confidence and refining skills relevant to their role.\n\n**30/60/90-Day Milestones:** These milestones are crucial for structured growth and feedback. They provide clear objectives for performance, professional development, and integration, ensuring the Program Assistant is supported in achieving their full potential and contributing effectively to our strategic goals.\n\n**Ongoing (recurring items):** The ongoing phase ensures continuous support, development, and integration. Regular check-ins, performance reviews, and professional development opportunities maintain engagement and allow for sustained contributions to the North Fork Food Justice Collective's mission. Pacing considerations are built in, ensuring a manageable workload for a small team.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Task Checklist Table\n\n[ALT-TEXT: Table with six columns: Priority, Task, Owner, Due Date/Window, Link/Resource, and Notes.

          "Major accuracy issue: Tasks reference tools not listed in the contradictory context section (e.g., 'Learn CRM/case management system' when context says 'None'), creating internal inconsistency",
          "Completeness gap: Missing explicit government-funded compliance items required by scenario (E-Verify, specific WV state tax forms, grant-related confidentiality protocols)",

Lila Chen coordinates equipment setup, email provisioning, and payroll enrollment in Gusto. Jada Williams finalizes the 30/60/90-day goals aligned with our food justice programs and arranges a buddy system. Marisol Vega sends a warm welcome email one week before start, sharing our mission and what to expect.\n\n**Day 1 (December 2, 2025)**  \nThe first day focuses on compliance, building connection, and essential IT setup. The new hire completes I-9 verification, signs the handbook acknowledgment, and receives equipment with a password manager walkthrough. Jada conducts a welcome meeting covering role expectations, program overviews, and community norms. We limit tasks to five essentials to avoid overwhelm and create space for informal team connection.\n\n**Week 1 (Days 2\u20135)**  \nThe Program Assistant meets each team member in 30-minute sessions to understand cross-departmental work\u2014Programs, Development, Finance, and volunteer coordination. Jada schedules shadowing during a community distribution event or partner meeting. Training covers Airtable (our CRM), Zoom protocols, and confidentiality for government-funded programs. The onboarding buddy checks in daily to answer questions and reinforce psychological safety.\n\n**Weeks 2\u20134**  \nFocus shifts to hands-on program support and deepening systems knowledge. The new hire attends funder reporting meetings, practices data entry in Airtable, and completes harassment prevention and safety training required for government compliance. Jada schedules weekly 1:1s to review progress on 30-day goals. By Day 30, the Program Assistant completes their first deliverable\u2014such as a volunteer schedule or community needs summary\u2014and receives structured feedback.\n\n**30/60/90-Day Milestones**  \nAt 30 days, we verify 100% training completion and system access. At 60 days, the new hire leads a program task independently (e.g., coordinating a food distribution). At 90 days, they achieve 75% of role-specific goals and co-create their professional development plan with Jada. Check-in surveys at each milestone ensure psychological safety and surface any support needs.\n\n**Ongoing**  \nRecurring activities include biweekly 1:1s with Jada, monthly all-staff meetings, quarterly strategic plan reviews, and annual performance evaluations. The buddy relationship transitions to peer mentorship. Continuous access to equity training, community listening sessions, and cross-training opportunities reinforce our justice-centered values.\n\n**Accessibility and Pacing Considerations**  \nThis checklist uses plain language and screen-reader-friendly table headers. For our small team (5\u201310 staff), we've marked optional tasks and spread responsibilities to prevent burnout. Low-cost alternatives (Google Forms, free e-signature tools) replace expensive software where possible, honoring our nonprofit budget constraints.\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 2 \u2014 TASK CHECKLIST\n\n| **Priority** | **Task** | **Owner** | **Due Date/Window** | **Link/Resource** | **Notes** |\n|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| **PRE-START (Day -14 to Day -1)** |\n| Essential | \u2610 Send offer letter with salary, benefits, start date | Lila Chen (OPS) | Day -14 | https://northforkfoodjustice.org/onboarding | Use free DocuSign alternative (HelloSign free tier) |\n| Essential | \u2610 Request background check per WV government-funded requirements | Lila Chen (OPS) | Day -14 | https://northforkfoodjustice.org/onboarding | Use county sheriff's office ($15\u2013$25 fee) |\n| Essential | \u2610 Set up email account and add to calendar | Lila Chen (OPS) | Day -10 | https://northforkfoodjustice.org/onboarding | Google Workspace;

        "reasoning": "The output fails to follow the prompt's explicit instructions in multiple critical ways. It reproduces Section 1 inputs unnecessarily, ignores the FORMAL tone requirement (using WARM AND PROFESSIONAL instead), contains numerous factual errors that contradict the scenario data, and omits required compliance elements for a healthcare organization. While the structure is reasonable, the execution demonstrates poor attention to detail that would undermine trust in a real nonprofit setting.",
        "strengths": [
          "Clear three-section structure with overview, table, and email templates as requested",
          "Includes appropriate healthcare compliance elements like HIPAA training and E-Verify",
          "Email templates are appropriately professional and welcoming with realistic content",
          "Table format is screen-reader friendly with proper headers and checkbox formatting",
          "Includes psychological safety elements like buddy system and feedback surveys"
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
          "CRITICAL: Reproduces Section 1 inputs in output despite prompt requiring only Sections 3 (Overview, Table, Templates) - wastes space and shows poor instruction-following",
          "CRITICAL: Uses WARM AND PROFESSIONAL tone despite scenario explicitly requiring FORMAL tone for healthcare/government-funded setting",
          "CRITICAL: Multiple data errors - lists 'Michael Chen' as Finance contact (should be Robert Kim), omits Sonia Patel as IT contact (lists N/A), omits Mark O'Leary as Facilities contact",
          "CRITICAL: Lists wrong tools - says 'Slack' when scenario specifies Microsoft Teams and Outlook/Exchange; omits Athenahealth EHR from initial setup despite being essential for healthcare data role",
          "Missing required compliance items: no child-safeguarding mention (healthcare often serves youth), no explicit confidentiality agreement signing task, no HIPAA BAA acknowledgment for Zoom",
          "Day 1 has 7 tasks but several could be pre-completed (I-9/W-4 should be Day -10 per own table), violating the 5-7 essential limit guidance",
          "Lacks Minnesota-specific compliance (state background check requirements, Minnesota tax forms beyond generic 'state tax')",
          "No explicit data security training beyond MFA - missing least-privilege access setup, data classification training critical for HIPAA role",

Jordan Alvarez processes offer documents, I-9 verification, background checks, and Minnesota tax forms. IT prepares email, Athenahealth EHR credentials, and Paylocity access. Dr. Priya Nair introduces the new hire to the team and assigns an onboarding buddy. Thomas Greene sends a welcome email highlighting our commitment to equitable health access across prairie communities.\n\n### Day 1 (December 9, 2025)\nThe new hire meets the team, reviews the employee handbook, completes HIPAA and data privacy training, and sets up multi-factor authentication and password manager access. Dr. Priya Nair holds a welcome meeting to review 90-day goals tied to our quality improvement strategic priorities. We limit Day 1 to six essential tasks to avoid overwhelm and allow time for relationship-building.\n\n### Week 1 (Days 2\u20135)\nThe new hire completes compliance training (HIPAA, harassment prevention, safety), attends 30-minute introductions with Programs, Finance, and Development teams, and begins Athenahealth EHR orientation. Dr. Priya Nair schedules shadowing sessions with current quality staff and sets a weekly 1:1 cadence. The onboarding buddy checks in daily to answer questions and model our collaborative culture.\n\n### Weeks 2\u20134\nThe Data and Quality Coordinator deepens technical skills through Athenahealth advanced training, password manager workshops, and data governance sessions. They attend a site visit (virtual or in-person) to meet beneficiaries and volunteers, reinforcing our mission. By Day 30, they complete their first deliverable\u2014a sample data quality audit\u2014and meet with Dr. Priya Nair and Jordan Alvarez for a formal check-in and feedback survey.\n\n### 30/60/90-Day Milestones\nAt 30 days, all system access and compliance training are complete, and the new hire has delivered one quality audit. At 60 days, they lead a small quality improvement project and present preliminary findings to the team. At 90 days, 75% of role-specific goals are achieved, and Dr. Priya Nair conducts a performance review to set Year 1 priorities. Each milestone includes a structured survey to gather feedback on onboarding experience and psychological safety.\n\n### Ongoing\nWeekly 1:1s with Dr. Priya Nair continue indefinitely. Monthly all-staff meetings reinforce mission alignment and equity norms. Quarterly training refreshers cover HIPAA updates, data security best practices, and donor stewardship protocols. The onboarding buddy transitions to a peer mentor relationship after 90 days.\n\n**Accessibility and Pacing:** This checklist uses plain language and screen-reader-friendly tables. For our mid-sized team (26\u201350 staff), tasks are distributed across Operations, IT, Supervisor, and Finance to avoid bottlenecks.

Amina Rahman coordinates contract execution, right-to-work verification, DBS check initiation (if applicable), and GDPR training enrollment. IT provisions email, Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack access, and communication tools. Amara Patel sends a welcome email, and Eleanor Shaw introduces the new hire to the team, fostering excitement and clarity about the role.\n\n**Day 1**  \nThe first day focuses on welcome, essential compliance, and systems access\u2014limited to five essential tasks to prevent overwhelm. The new hire meets Eleanor Shaw for a structured orientation, completes mandatory GDPR and data security acknowledgments, and receives equipment and building access. Amina Rahman facilitates a welcome session covering mission, values, and team norms, ensuring the Major Gifts Officer feels grounded in our culture and purpose.\n\n**Week 1 (Days 2\u20135)**  \nDuring the first week, the new hire meets cross-functional colleagues (Programs, Finance, Communications), completes role-specific training on Salesforce and Workday HCM, and begins shadowing Eleanor Shaw on donor stewardship activities. A designated onboarding buddy supports informal questions and cultural acclimation. We prioritize psychological safety through feedback check-ins and realistic pacing, recognizing that smaller teams require flexibility.\n\n**Weeks 2\u20134**  \nThe Major Gifts Officer transitions from observation to active contribution, drafting their first donor outreach, attending donor meetings, and refining 30/60/90-day goals aligned with our strategic plan. Weekly 1:1s with Eleanor Shaw provide structured feedback and skill development. Training continues on confidentiality protocols, gift acknowledgment workflows, and GDPR compliance for donor data management. By Day 30, the new hire completes all mandatory training and delivers their first substantive project.\n\n**30/60/90-Day Milestones**  \nStructured check-ins at 30, 60, and 90 days measure progress against role-specific goals: system proficiency, relationship building with key donors, and pipeline development. Anonymous feedback surveys ensure continuous improvement of our onboarding process. Success metrics include 100% training completion by Day 30, first donor proposal by Day 60, and 75% achievement of 90-day goals.\n\n**Ongoing**  \nRecurring tasks\u2014weekly supervision, monthly Development team meetings, quarterly performance reviews, and annual GDPR refresher training\u2014sustain growth and accountability. We maintain accessibility through plain-language materials, screen-reader-compatible resources, and inclusive meeting practices, ensuring all team members can fully participate.\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 2 \u2014 TASK CHECKLIST TABLE\n\n| **Priority** | **Task** | **Owner** | **Due Date/Window** | **Link/Resource** | **Notes** |\n|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| **PRE-START (Days -14 to -1)** |\n| Essential | \u2610 Send contract with salary, benefits, start date | Amina Rahman (OPS) | Day -14 | https://geftrust.org/onboarding/contract-template | Use free DocuSign alternative (PandaDoc free tier) |\n| Essential | \u2610 Collect right-to-work documentation (passport/visa/share code) | Amina Rahman (OPS) | Day -10 | https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work | Required UK compliance;
