      "content": "This is a CASUAL plan for Otero County Food & Wellness Coalition\u2019s Harvest Health Fair & Block Party.\n\n### PART 1: Executive Summary\n\nHey team! This plan rockets us toward our first-ever Harvest Health Fair & Block Party on September 21, 2026. This isn't just any block party; it's a Community Festival designed to connect with families and local small businesses in Otero County. We're aiming for 120 attendees and a total budget of $5K\u201310K, hoping to net $8K, with $5K of that coming from 5 awesome sponsors. Our ideal spot is an outdoor park (with a rain plan!), and it'll be a solo ED + board committee effort. We've got a few quirks to navigate: first-time event, limited rural vendor options, a hard deadline to book our venue by May 1, 2026, limited AV capabilities, and board approval needed for anything over $5K. To make sure everyone feels welcome, we're planning for bilingual Spanish/English support, ASL for the main stage, ADA portable ramps, and keeping it green with compostables only.\n\nOur critical path focuses on securing our venue *fast* to hit that May 1st deadline, nailing down those 5 sponsors early to fuel our efforts, designing a welcoming and accessible program, getting the word out to families, and ensuring we have a smooth, well-rehearsed event day. The biggest risks are vendor lead times in a rural area (mitigated by buffer zones and early outreach), getting board approvals promptly (clear communication and early submissions), and, of course, Mother Nature \u2013 hence the rain plan! We'll lean on the ED for overall coordination and the board committee for direct support, especially with sponsorship outreach and on-the-day logistics. Our main gap will be a dedicated volunteer lead, so we\u2019ll need to empower a board member or recruit someone enthusiastically for that role.\n\n### PART 2: Detailed Timeline Table\n\n| Milestone Phase | Task | Owner | Due Date (calendar) | Lead Time | Duration | Dependencies | Priority | Status | Notes/Risks | Cost/Revenue Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **T-6m (03/21/2026)** | **Venue short-list & site visits for potential park locations** | ED + Committee | 03/28/2026 | 1 week | 1 week | Budget approved | P1 | Not Started | *[LEAD-TIME FLAG]* Need to identify park options with rain plan capabilities.

It demonstrates strong understanding of nonprofit event planning constraints and rural context, though it has minor inconsistencies in task formatting and a few missing elements from the detailed requirements.",
        "strengths": [
          "Excellent tone execution - casual yet professional ('Hey team!', 'awesome sponsors', 'Get up early, stay calm!') that fits a small rural nonprofit without sacrificing clarity",
          "Strong contextual adaptation - acknowledges rural vendor limitations, first-time event challenges, and solo ED capacity throughout the plan",
          "Comprehensive critical path identification - correctly prioritizes venue deadline (05/01/2026), sponsorship pipeline, and accessibility requirements with appropriate urgency",
          "Effective use of lead-time flags and buffers - consistently marks vendor-dependent tasks and applies 10-12% buffers as specified",
          "Bilingual and accessibility requirements well-integrated - ASL interpreter, ADA ramps, Spanish/English support appear in multiple phases with specific checkpoints",
          "Realistic task granularity for team size - avoids overwhelming a solo ED with overly complex processes while maintaining necessary rigor",
          "Strong post-event follow-up - includes sponsor stewardship, data management, and template creation for sustainability",

          "Table formatting inconsistency - 'Comms\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba' appears instead of 'Comms' in one row (likely encoding error), and some duration estimates seem optimistic (1 day for accessibility audit)",
          "Revenue/cost impact column underutilized - many tasks lack specific dollar amounts or pipeline estimates that would help with budget tracking",
          "Rain plan mentioned multiple times but never detailed - given outdoor venue constraint, should include specific trigger points and alternative logistics",
          "Volunteer recruitment timeline may be tight - starting at T-2m for a first-time event with 10 volunteers needed; T-3m would be safer",
          "Missing explicit food donation/sustainability plan for compostables - requirement mentioned but not operationalized in timeline"

It demonstrates deep understanding of small nonprofit constraints and rural context. Minor accuracy concerns around cost estimates and some timeline compression, but overall highly functional.",
        "strengths": [
          "Excellent tone calibration: casual, jargon-free, realistic ('keep meetings time-boxed,' 'print-light,' 'if behind, add $75 in boosts') without being cutesy or condescending",
          "Outstanding contextual adaptation: acknowledges 'limited rural vendor options,' 'solo ED + board committee' capacity, first-time event risks, and builds in practical workarounds (digital-first flyers, bulk compostables order, simplified AV)",
          "Highly actionable task formatting: every task includes specific deliverables, realistic durations, clear owners, and concrete cost/revenue impacts (e.g., 'Sponsor outreach batch 1: 12 prospects' not 'engage sponsors')",
          "Strong accessibility integration: ASL, bilingual content, ADA ramps, quiet areas, and sensory considerations are woven throughout rather than tacked on",
          "Excellent use of [TEMPLATE] and [LEAD-TIME FLAG] markers for reusability and risk management\u201462 tasks with clear dependencies and buffers",
          "Realistic budget modeling: $7.5K spend assumption with itemized vendor costs, 12% buffers, and fee structures (2.9% + $0.30/txn) shows practical financial literacy",
          "Smart prioritization: P1 tasks (venue, permits, sponsorship, accessibility) clearly differentiated from P2/P3; critical path is evident",

          "Timeline compression in T-4m phase: collapsing T-6m and T-4m work (venue, budget approval, sponsorship launch) into 8 weeks is aggressive for a first-time event with board approval requirements\u2014could create bottleneck if board meets monthly",
          "Revenue model assumptions need clarification: targeting net $8K on $7.5K budget implies $15.5K gross, but sponsorship ($5K) + booth fees ($1.5K) + day-of donations ($2K est.) = $8.5K, leaving $7K gap unexplained (likely registration fees/vendor revenue not explicitly modeled)",

With an estimated 120 attendees, a total budget of $5K\u201310K, and a net revenue goal of $8K (supported by $5K from 5 sponsors), this first-time event will be held in an outdoor park with a rain backup plan. The fair aims to promote food security, wellness resources, and community connection through hands-on activities, vendor booths, health screenings, and entertainment. Accessibility features include bilingual Spanish/English materials, ASL interpretation for the main stage, ADA portable ramps, and compostable-only serviceware.\n\n**Critical Path Milestones:**\n1. **Venue secured by 05/01/2026** (T-4.7m) \u2014 hard deadline per venue policy; delay risks losing site and pushing back all logistics.\n2. **Sponsorship agreements signed by 06/15/2026** (T-3.3m) \u2014 ensures $5K in revenue; print deadlines depend on confirmed sponsor logos.\n3. **Permits finalized by 07/01/2026** (T-2.7m) \u2014 park use, food vendor health permits, and potential music licensing; delays halt vendor recruitment.\n4. **Volunteer recruitment complete by 08/15/2026** (T-5w) \u2014 15\u201320 volunteers needed; training must occur T-2w to ensure day-of readiness.\n5. **Marketing launch by 06/21/2026** (T-3m) \u2014 registration platform live, social/email cadence begins; must hit 60% registration by T-1m to justify vendor/catering commitments.\n6. **Catering guarantee submitted by 09/14/2026** (T-1w) \u2014 internal deadline set 5 days early to buffer vendor lead time; tied to final attendance count.\n7. **ASL/accessibility audit complete by 08/10/2026** (T-6w) \u2014 confirms ADA compliance, wayfinding, dietary accommodation workflow.\n\n**Key Risks & Mitigations:**\n- **Vendor availability (rural area):** Start RFPs at T-4m; maintain backup lists for catering, AV, rentals, and portable restrooms.\n- **Weather contingency:** Secure rain venue hold by T-3m; communicate plan to attendees T-1w; have tarps/tents as fallback.\n- **Board approval >$5K:** Route budget and venue contract through board by T-5m to avoid delays.\n- **Capacity constraints (solo ED + board committee):** Delegate program/logistics tasks to 2\u20133 board volunteers; recruit volunteer captains by T-2m; leverage templates for comms/forms to save time.\n\n**Resource Summary:**\n- **Staffing:** Solo Executive Director + 4-person board event committee (meeting bi-weekly T-4m through event day).\n- **Volunteers:** 15\u201320 day-of volunteers (check-in, activity stations, setup/breakdown); 2 volunteer captains.\n- **Vendors:** Caterer (taco/BBQ trucks or local restaurants), AV (sound system + wireless mics for stage), tent/table/chair rentals, portable restroom company, ASL interpreter (2 hours), print shop (bilingual signage/programs).\n- **Gaps:** No dedicated comms or logistics staff; ED will manage sponsor outreach and vendor coordination; board committee absorbs program design and volunteer recruitment. Consider recruiting a pro-bono day-of coordinator from community partners.\n\n---\n\n## PART 2: DETAILED TIMELINE TABLE\n\n| **Milestone Phase** | **Task** | **Owner** | **Due Date** | **Lead Time** | **Duration** | **Dependencies** | **Priority** | **Status** | **Notes/Risks** | **Cost/Revenue Impact** |\n|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| **T-6m** (03/21/2026) | Form event planning committee: recruit 4 board members, set bi-weekly meeting schedule (Thursdays 5\u20136pm) | ED | 03/21/2026 | 6 months | 2 weeks | \u2014 | P1 | Not Started | First-time event; need engaged board members willing to own tasks.

Scheduled for **April 17, 2026**, this hybrid event targets 350 attendees, leveraging a hotel ballroom with breakout rooms for an immersive experience. The Summit boasts a budget of $50K\u2013100K, with an ambitious fundraising goal of Gross $180K and Net $25K, including $60K from 8 key sponsors. Our dedicated team of 3 full-time staff, augmented by 12 volunteers, will execute this complex event.\n\n**Critical Path Milestones:**\n1.  **Venue Contract & Deposit (10/17/2025):** Securing the appropriate venue and finalizing contractual obligations by T-6 months is paramount. Delays here would fundamentally disrupt all subsequent planning.\n2.  **Sponsorship Launch & First Agreements (12/17/2025):** Initiating sponsorship outreach by T-4 months and securing initial commitments is vital for budget certainty and leveraging their networks.\n3.  **Marketing & Registration Launch (01/17/2026):** Timely public promotion and accessible registration are key to achieving attendance goals, with conversion checkpoints built in.\n4.  **Speaker Confirmations & Program Finalization (02/17/2026):** Locking in speakers and the program content by T-2 months ensures rich, relevant content and allows for effective promotion.\n5.  **Catering Guarantee & Final Attendee Push (04/03/2026):** Ensuring an accurate headcount for catering by T-2 weeks, alongside a final marketing push, is crucial for financial management and attendance targets.\n6.  **Full Tech/Payment Rehearsal (04/10/2026):** Given the hybrid nature and payment collection, a comprehensive rehearsal a week prior is essential to prevent technical failures.\n\n**Key Risks and Mitigations:**\n*   **Vendor Timelines:** Contractual clauses will specify penalties for missed deadlines, and a 15% buffer will be applied to all external deliverables. Regular check-ins will be maintained.\n*   **Approvals (Board/Budget):** Board approval for expenditures over $5K will be submitted with ample lead time (e.g., 2 weeks prior to required decision date) to avoid bottlenecks.\n*   **Technology Failures (Hybrid Event):** A dedicated AV vendor with on-site support, backup internet (hotspots), and a clear incident response plan will be in place. Union AV requirements at the venue will be fully integrated into planning.\n*   **Budget Shortfalls:** Proactive sponsorship recruitment and a tiered registration structure will be implemented. Contingency funds will be allocated.\n\n**Resource Summary:** The event relies on 3 FT staff (spanning Development, Programs, Communications), supported by 12 volunteers managed by a Volunteer Lead. Key vendors include the hotel (venue/catering), Union AV, and printers. A professional day-of coordinator will be engaged for seamless execution. Potential gaps exist in dedicated support for accessibility audits and intricate hybrid stream management, which will be addressed through specific vendor contracts and a robust Accessibility Plan.\n\n---\n\n## PART 2: Detailed Timeline Table\n\n**Event Name:** STEM Equity Summit 2026\n**Event Date:** 04/17/2026\n**Organization:** Pacific Northwest STEM Educators Network\n**Event Type:** Conference/Summit\n**Attendees:** 350\n\n| Milestone Phase | Task | Owner | Due Date (calendar) | Lead Time | Duration | Dependencies | Priority | Status | Notes/Risks | Cost/Revenue Impact |\n| :-------------- | :--- | :---- | :------------------ | :-------- | :------- | :----------- | :------- | :----- | :---------- | :------------------ |\n| **(T-6 Months)** | **Venue Shortlist & Site Visits** | Programs | 10/03/2025 | 2 weeks | 1 week | Budget approval | P1 | Not Started | Ensure ADA compliance and capacity for hybrid setup. | N/A |\n| **(T-6 Months)** | **Draft Budget + Revenue Model for Board Approval** | Finance | 10/10/2025 | 1 week | 1 week | Previous year data | P1 | Not Started | Board approval >$5K required for venue deposit. | N/A |\n| **(T-6 Months)** | **Event Committee Formation & First Meeting** | ED/Program | 10/10/2025 | 1 week | 1 week | N/A | P2 | Not Started | Define roles (sponsorship, marketing, program). | N/A |\n| **(T-6 Months)** | **Secure Venue: Contract Signed & Deposit Paid** | ED/Finance | 10/17/2025 | 1 week | 1 week | Board budget approval | P1 | Not Started | Venue deposit due 10/15/2025.

Core goals: convene K\u201312 district leaders, teachers, corporate tech partners, and university liaisons; elevate equitable STEM practices; and secure sponsor/registration revenue to sustain programs. Accessibility is integral: ASL + live captioning, bilingual Spanish/English materials, lactation and quiet rooms, ADA seating/wayfinding, vegetarian/halal options, and hybrid streaming.\n\nBudget and revenue assumptions\nOptional inputs indicate Gross $180K; Net $25K with $60K from 8 sponsors. This implies ~ $155K in expenses (i.e., expense band closer to $100K+ despite the $50K\u2013100K range). Action: reconcile and approve final working budget with Finance/Board at T-6m.\n\nCritical path (must-hit milestones)\n- Venue contract signed/deposit paid by 10/15/2025; COIs and union AV rules confirmed [LEAD-TIME FLAG].\n- Marketing/registration launch 01/17/2026; conversion checkpoints 25% by 02/17, 60% by 03/17, 85% by 04/03.\n- Vendor RFPs/selection (catering, AV, printing, rentals, streaming/captioning/ASL) by 12/17/2025; contracts approved (board approval >$5K).\n- Program locked: theme/tracks/speakers held by 01/17; run-of-show v2 and rehearsal date by 03/17.\n- Accessibility plan locked by 02/17; Accessibility Audit at 03/06.\n- Signage/print to printer with 10\u201315% buffer by 03/29; proofs finalized by 04/03 [LEAD-TIME FLAG].\n- Catering guarantee submitted by 04/10 (internal 04/05) [LEAD-TIME FLAG].\n\nKey risks + mitigations\n- Vendor/union AV timelines: pre-book, include 15% schedule buffer; obtain COIs early; add backup internet and tech rehearsal.\n- Budget variance: seek board approvals early; hold 12% contingency; lock scope at T-1m.\n- Hybrid/tech failure: redundant hotspots, spare readers, backup slide laptop; full tech rehearsal at T-1w.\n- Speaker travel: book by T-2m; hold refundable fares; confirm ground transport.\n\nResources\nTeam: 3 FT + 12 volunteers; add a professional day-of coordinator, dedicated registration lead, and security vendor.

      "content": "# STEM Equity Summit 2026 \u2013 Event Planning Timeline\n**Pacific Northwest STEM Educators Network | April 17, 2026**\n\n---\n\n## PART 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe STEM Equity Summit 2026 will convene 350 K\u201312 district leaders, teachers, corporate tech partners, and university liaisons on April 17, 2026, in a hybrid hotel ballroom setting. The event targets $180K gross revenue and $25K net, with $60K from eight corporate sponsors (2 \u00d7 $15K, 4 \u00d7 $7.5K, 2 \u00d7 $5K) and an estimated $50K\u2013100K total budget. The summit advances equity in STEM education through keynote sessions, breakout workshops, and networking, with robust accessibility features including ASL interpretation, live captioning, bilingual Spanish/English materials, lactation and quiet rooms, diverse dietary options, and hybrid streaming.\n\n**Critical Path Milestones:**\n\n1. **Venue Contract & Deposit (10/15/2025, T-6m):** Venue deposit deadline is contractually fixed; delay jeopardizes room block and AV setup. Union AV requirements demand early coordination.\n2. **Sponsorship Deck & Outreach Launch (12/17/2025, T-4m):** Securing $60K from eight sponsors requires 12\u201316 weeks of cultivation; delays compress follow-up cycles and risk revenue shortfall.\n3. **Registration & Marketing Launch (01/17/2026, T-3m):** Platform accessibility (alt text, keyboard navigation, contrast) and bilingual content require three weeks' setup; late launch prevents reaching 60% registration by T-1m.\n4. **Speaker Travel Support & Accessibility Holds (02/17/2026, T-2m):** Airline pricing escalates closer to event; ASL/captioning vendors book out 8\u201310 weeks ahead.\n5. **Catering Guarantee Submission (04/03/2026, T-2w):** Hotel contract mandates final counts 14 days prior; internal deadline April 1 buffers last-minute registrations.\n6. **Volunteer Training & Tech Rehearsal (04/10/2026, T-1w):** Hybrid streaming, mobile check-in, and accessibility protocols require full run-through to avoid day-of failures.\n7. **Board Approval for Contracts >$5K (by 11/01/2025):** AV, catering, and speaker travel contracts trigger governance threshold; late approval cascades to all vendor timelines.\n\n**Key Risks & Mitigations:**\n\n- *Vendor Lead Times:* Union AV, hotel F&B, and ASL interpreter availability are 8\u201312 week minimums. **[LEAD-TIME FLAG]** All contracts include force majeure clauses; backup interpreter agency identified.\n- *Budget Constraints:* 15% buffer applied to all external costs; monthly finance reviews track variance. Slippage >12% escalates to ED/Board.\n- *Hybrid Technology:* Internet redundancy (hardline + two hotspots), dedicated streaming tech, and backup recording plan mitigate connectivity failures.\n- *Sponsorship Pipeline:* If 50% of $60K goal not secured by T-3m, activate contingency outreach to 10 additional prospects and reduce non-essential AV.\n\n**Resource Summary:**\n\n- **Team:** 3 FT staff (Development Director, Programs Manager, Communications Coordinator) + 12 volunteers (roles: registration, session support, speaker liaisons, accessibility ambassadors).\n- **Vendors:** Hotel (venue/catering), union AV, ASL/captioning provider, printing, hybrid streaming platform.\n- **Gaps:** No dedicated day-of coordinator budgeted; Programs Manager assumes role. If registration exceeds 300 by T-1m, hire temp event support ($800\u20131,200).\n\n---\n\n## PART 2: DETAILED TIMELINE TABLE\n\n| **Milestone Phase** | **Task** | **Owner** | **Due Date** | **Lead Time** | **Duration** | **Dependencies** | **Priority** | **Status** | **Notes/Risks (Mitigation)** | **Cost/Revenue Impact** |\n|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **T-6m (10/17/2025)** | Venue short-list: research 4 hotel options with hybrid AV capability, accessibility (ADA rooms, elevators, lactation room), breakout capacity for 350 | Programs Manager | 10/03/2025 | 6 weeks | 1 week | Budget approved | P1 | Not Started | Union AV at venue mandatory;

next board meeting assumed October 1, 2025.\n- Volunteer background checks assumed required (educational setting); 2-week processing time.\n- Union AV at venue is non-negotiable per labor agreements; external vendors coordinate only for streaming.\n- Sponsor renewal outreach included assuming this may become recurring event; if first-time, omit and focus on 2027 prospect research instead.\n\n**Critical Reminders:**\n- **Lead-time flags:** Venue deposit (10/15/25), ASL/captioning (8\u201310 weeks), catering guarantee (14 days), sponsor logo print deadline (3 weeks before event).\n- **Buffers applied:** 15% on external vendor timelines, 12% on budget, 10% on catering overage.\n- **Conversion checkpoints:** 25% registration by T-2m, 60% by T-1m, 85% by T-2w.\n- **Accessibility audit at T-6w (03/06/26)** is mandatory checkpoint.\n- **Templates marked** for reuse in 2027 planning cycle.\n\nThis timeline provides a comprehensive, realistic roadmap for a complex 350-person hybrid summit with equity and accessibility at the center.

      "content": "## PART 1: Executive Summary\n\nThe Harbor City Children\u2019s Hospital Foundation is celebrating a significant milestone with its 50th Anniversary Gala & Auction on November 14, 2026. This Gala, targeting 600 attendees, aims to net an ambitious $1.2 million, with $750,000 sourced from 12 key sponsors (3 x $100K presenting, 3 x $50K, 6 x $25K). The event will be hosted at a unionized hotel ballroom, requiring meticulous planning around union labor rules and strict load-in windows. Professional staging, lighting, and valet services are planned to enhance the attendee experience, alongside a live and silent auction, paddle raise, ASL interpretation, and specialized dietary options.\n\nOur critical path is centered on securing the venue with a paid deposit by May 14, 2026, launching our comprehensive sponsorship drive by June 14, 2026, implementing a robust multi-channel marketing and registration campaign by August 14, 2026, locking in our catering guarantee by October 27, 2026 (internal deadline), and developing an ironclad run-of-show including fundraising mechanisms by October 31, 2026. These milestones are interdependent and crucial for reaching our financial and attendance goals.\n\nKey risks include vendor lead times, particularly for the unionized hotel and AV services, which will be mitigated by building 10-15% buffer into all external deliverables and securing COIs from all vendors. Board approvals for budget and key vendors can delay progress, necessitating proactive scheduling and clear communication. The hotel catering guarantee is a hard deadline; an early internal deadline will prevent last-minute issues. Our budget of $100K+ will be carefully managed through a 12% cost contingency and continuous tracking.\n\nOur team, consisting of 6 full-time Development staff, an Events Manager, and 40 dedicated volunteers, is well-positioned for success. However, given the high-security VIPs and the scale of the event, dedicated security vendor management will be crucial. We will also plan for additional site visits and a dedicated registration lead to ensure a seamless experience.\n\n## PART 2: Detailed Timeline Table\n\n| Milestone Phase | Task | Owner | Due Date (calendar) | Lead Time | Duration | Dependencies | Priority | Status | Notes/Risks | Cost/Revenue Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **T-6m (May 14, 2026)** | Shortlist 3 venues: hotel ballroom, union house requirements, valet | Events Manager | 05/01/2026 | 3 weeks | 2 weeks | Board criteria for venue | P1 | Not Started | Ensure union rules are clear from initial contact | N/A |\n| **T-6m (May 14, 2026)** | **[LEAD-TIME FLAG]** Site visits, negotiate terms, contract signed for Hotel ballroom, deposit paid | Events Manager | 05/14/2026 | 2 weeks | 1 week | Venue shortlist | P1 | Not Started | Hotel catering guarantee by 10/31/2026;

Goals: celebrate 50 years of impact, deepen relationships with major donors/corporate leaders/grateful families, and net $1.2M. Revenue pillars: $750K from 12 sponsors (3 x $100K presenting, 3 x $50K, 6 x $25K), live + silent auction, and paddle raise. The venue is a union hotel ballroom with staging/lighting and valet; we\u2019ll operate within limited load-in windows, strict house rules, and a 10% schedule buffer. We will maintain a 12% cost contingency and 15% buffer on print assets.\n\nCritical path (must-hit): \n- Board-approved budget + contracting thresholds (unlocks vendors).\n- Hotel contract + insurance/COIs (union rules; load-in windows).\n- Sponsorship launch and closes (funding engine; benefits delivery).\n- Marketing/registration launch (hit 25% by T-2m, 60% by T-1m, 85% by T-2w).\n- AV/staging/lighting design lock + rehearsal (program success).\n- Auction procurement + mobile bidding build (fundraising).\n- Final run-of-show, catering guarantee by 10/31, and full tech/payment rehearsal.\n\nKey risks + mitigations: \n- Vendor lead times/union constraints: [LEAD-TIME FLAG] items locked early; 10\u201315% schedule buffers. \n- High-security VIPs: dedicated security vendor + venue/VIP briefings; credentialing.\n- Tech/payment failure: backup hotspots, spare readers, paper forms; dress rehearsal.\n- Branding/print delays: 15% buffer; internal approvals early.\n- Budget creep: 12% contingency; finance checkpoints.\n\nResources: Development (6 FT) + Events Manager + 40 volunteers; hotel catering; AV/staging; security; valet; photo/video; auctioneer/mobile bidding; ASL; printers; d\u00e9cor/florals; professional day-of coordinator; registration lead; stage manager. Gaps covered: security coordinator function, dedicated registration lead, and stage manager included in plan.\n\nAssumptions noted: Total event budget $100K+ with 12% contingency.

The event targets net revenue of $1.2M through ticket sales, a $750K sponsorship program (3 \u00d7 $100K presenting, 3 \u00d7 $50K, 6 \u00d7 $25K), and live/silent auction plus paddle raise. The program includes ASL interpretation, kosher-style and gluten-free menus, step-and-repeat, and professional photo/video capture. A 6-FT development team, events manager, and 40 volunteers will execute under a $100K+ budget.\n\n**Critical Path (Must-Hit Milestones)**  \n1. **Venue Contract Signed (05/14/2026, T-6m):** Union house requires load-in coordination; hold expires quickly; any delay cascades vendors and catering guarantee.  \n2. **Sponsor Agreements Executed (07/14/2026, T-4m):** $750K represents 63% of net goal; late execution jeopardizes print deadlines and sponsor benefits fulfillment.  \n3. **Catering Guarantee Submitted (10/31/2026, T-2w internal):** Hotel contractual deadline; internal target 10/28 to absorb late RSVPs.  \n4. **Auction Procurement Complete (09/14/2026, T-2m):** Mobile bidding catalog preview launches T-1m; late items miss donor engagement window.  \n5. **Volunteer Training Conducted (10/28/2026, T-2.5w):** 40 volunteers span check-in, auction spotting, accessibility, donor stewardship; untrained volunteers risk donor experience and pledge capture.  \n6. **Run-of-Show Final (10/31/2026, T-2w):** AV cues, ASL sync, paddle raise script, VIP escort protocol; late changes incur union labor penalties.  \n7. **Board Approvals for >$5K Expenditures (06/14/2026, T-5m):** Major vendor contracts (AV, catering, rentals) require formal board sign-off; any delay stalls RFPs.\n\n**Key Risks & Mitigations**  \n\u2022 **Vendor Lead Times:** Union labor rules limit load-in windows; mitigation: internal deadlines 10% earlier, confirmed load-in schedule by T-3m.  \n\u2022 **VIP Security:** High-net-worth attendees require discrete security; mitigation: hire licensed vendor by T-4m, conduct walk-through T-2w.  \n\u2022 **Sponsorship Pipeline:** $750K from 12 sponsors is ambitious; mitigation: prospect list of 30 (2.5\u00d7 target), biweekly outreach cadence, tracking dashboard reviewed weekly.  \n\u2022 **Catering Guarantee Timing:** Hotel penalty for late count; mitigation: internal deadline 10/28 (3 days before contractual), final attendance push T-3w.  \n\u2022 **COI Delays:** All vendors require certificates of insurance; mitigation: COI request sent with contract signature, tracked in shared sheet, escalation to ED if not received T-4w.  \n\u2022 **Accessibility Audit Gap:** ASL, dietary, ADA seating complex; mitigation: dedicated accessibility audit T-6w (10/01/2026) with checklist and remediation budget reserve.\n\n**Resource Summary**  \n\u2022 **Internal:** 6 FT development staff, events manager (lead), 40 trained volunteers (recruitment starts T-8w). **Gap:** Day-of coordinator (recommend hire T-3m, ~$3K).  \n\u2022 **External:** Union venue, full-service caterer, AV/staging, mobile bidding platform, security (2 officers), valet, ASL interpreter, photo/video crew, printing vendor.  \n\u2022 **Board/Committee:** Event committee (8 members) meets monthly T-6m onward; finance committee approves budget T-6m, major contracts T-5m.  \n\u2022 **Volunteers:** 40 across shifts (setup 2pm, event 5\u201310pm, breakdown); roles: registration (8), auction spotting (6), VIP escort (4), accessibility (2), coat check (4), general hospitality (12), breakdown (4).

Minor verbosity in some task descriptions is the only notable weakness, but this actually enhances clarity for less-experienced users.",

          "Brilliant use of specific, actionable task formatting with clear owners, dependencies, and mitigation strategies (e.g., 'internal deadline 10/28 = 3 days buffer' for catering guarantee)",
          "Comprehensive fundraising integration: sponsorship pipeline tracking, auction procurement calendar, paddle raise mechanics, and AR follow-up are all properly sequenced",

          "The 60-task table, while comprehensive, may be overwhelming for smaller teams to adapt; a 'quick-start' version for orgs with <200 attendees would enhance accessibility",
          "Minor authenticity concern: the level of polish and completeness is almost *too* perfect\u2014real event timelines evolve messily, and acknowledging iteration (e.g., 'this is v1; expect updates after committee review') would feel more genuine"
