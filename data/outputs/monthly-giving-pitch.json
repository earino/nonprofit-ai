Become a monthly art sustainer today!\n\n---\n\nDear [Donor Name],\n\nRemember that amazing feeling you got when you supported South Side Arts Collective recently? As school bells ring again, we're buzzing with excitement \u2013 and a little bit of healthy pressure! Our Open Studio Afternoons are filling up fast for the fall, and we're getting ready to welcome even more talented teens.\n\nYour recent one-time gift was a huge help. It gave a young artist the chance to pick up a paintbrush or sculpt with clay. Now, imagine if that support could be there, every single month, like a steady beacon for creativity.\n\nThat's why we're inviting you to join our **Canvas Crew Monthly**. By giving a little regularly, you create a reliable foundation for all our free after-school arts education and mentoring. It ensures we can keep the lights on, our amazing teaching artists scheduled, and vital art supplies stocked for every student who walks through our doors.\n\nThink about it:\n\n*   **For about the cost of a fancy coffee ($5.25 a week)**, your $25 monthly gift creates a world of difference.\n*   **A monthly gift of $15** means a steady $180 over the year. That's enough to cover 18 student studio hours, giving many teens a chance to explore art.\n*   **Your $25 monthly contribution** adds up to $300 annually. That equips 12 teens with a sketchbook and essential supplies, sparking their artistic journey.\n*   **With $50 a month**, you provide $600 each year. This funds 10 hours of a teaching artist\u2019s time, helping countless students learn and grow.\n\nLife changes, and so can your giving. You can change or cancel your monthly gift at any time \u2013 no questions asked!\n\nWe know you generously gave recently, and we're so grateful for that. This is just an invitation to make an even bigger, more consistent impact. It\u2019s about creating a dependable flow of support so we can plan ahead and offer the best programs possible.\n\nAs a member of our **Canvas Crew Monthly**, you'll also get some cool perks:\n\n*   Early invites to student showcases\n*   Behind-the-scenes studio updates\n*   A special member sticker and digital badge\n*   One annual consolidated receipt for easy tax prep\n\nKnowing my monthly gift keeps the lights on and the studio open after school makes me proud to be part of the Collective. \u2013 Juanita R., Canvas Crew Monthly Donor\n\nReady to make a lasting difference?

Your steady monthly gift powers the Urban Shorelines Project.\n\nBody\nSpring along Lake Erie means planting, rooting, and restoring. Thanks to your recent gift, the Urban Shorelines Project is on track this month to install 2,500 native shoreline plants and run water-quality tests from the Cuyahoga River mouth to Euclid Creek.\n\nMonthly giving is how this work stays steady. Your reliable support keeps lights on, crews scheduled, volunteers equipped, and water testing continuous\u2014week in, week out\u2014so we can plan restoration days and deliver what our shoreline needs.\n\nChoose a monthly amount that fits:\n- $20/month \u2014 about $4.75 a week (roughly one coffee)\n- $35/month \u2014 about one nice coffee every 3\u20134 days\n- $60/month \u2014 about two coffees a week\n\nWhat your gift can do over a year:\n- $20/month ($240): plant up to 80 native shoreline plants; or equip 16 volunteers for workdays; or supply 6 monthly water-quality test kits.\n- $35/month ($420): plant up to 140 plants; or equip 28 volunteers; or provide roughly 10 monthly test kits.\n- $60/month ($720): plant up to 240 plants; or equip 48 volunteers; or fund 18 monthly test kits.\n\nYou\u2019re in control. You can change or cancel anytime. Prefer ACH/bank transfer? Great\u2014it reduces fees. You can also add $1\u2013$2 to cover fees\u2014totally optional.\n\nAlready gave? Thank you. Your one-time gift made an immediate difference. A modest monthly gift now sustains the work so we can schedule staff, train volunteers, and restore more shoreline all season.\n\nJoin Lake Guardians Monthly and enjoy:\n- Quarterly science briefings with our ecologists\n- Invitation to members-only restoration days\n- Interactive impact map access\n- Annual consolidated tax receipt\n\n\u201cAs a Lake Erie kayaker, I see the difference native plants make.
