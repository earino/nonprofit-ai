We heard your feedback and are actively strengthening our supply chain. To address this, we've secured a new gleaning partner (rescuing unsold produce from local farms) and invested in a shared cooler. We\u2019re also piloting prepaid bulk buys with local vendors to stabilize the supply of popular items. We continue to learn and adapt to best serve our community.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nAs we move into the end of the year, we're focused on preparing warm, nutritious food for the holiday season. Our goal is to serve 1,500 households by December 31st.\n\n---\n\n**See the Full Q3 Impact Report**\n\n[Button: View Full Report](https://eastsidefoodalliance.org/reports/q3-2025-impact)\n\n---\n\nWant to get more involved?\n\n**Sign up for a market shift in October!**\nhttps://eastsidefoodalliance.org/volunteer\n\n---\n\nYour commitment to Eastside Food Alliance creates healthier, more connected communities.

In Knott County, one farmer, Earlene M., shared, \"This creek ran orange when I was a kid. Now my grandkids can see minnows again.\" Her words capture the profound impact of improving water quality in areas like the Kentucky River and Tug Fork sub-watersheds.\n\n**Learning and Adapting for Future Success**\n\nThe fall of 2024 brought its share of challenges. Two significant storm events delayed plantings and damaged silt fencing on three critical sites. We responded by updating erosion control plans, extending contractor timelines without incurring additional costs, and securing contingency plant material. These adaptive measures ensure we remain on track to meet our spring planting targets.\n\n**What's Next? Accelerating Towards Our Goals**\n\nWith **52% growth** in miles of streams improved since FY24, we are energized for the second half of FY25.

Earlene M., a local farmer whose name is used to protect privacy, told us, \u201cThis creek ran orange when I was a kid. Now my grandkids can see minnows again.\u201d\n\nChallenge and what we learned\nTwo fall storms delayed plantings and damaged silt fencing on three sites. We updated erosion control plans, extended contractor timelines without cost overruns, and added contingency plant material to hit spring targets. We are adjusting scheduling buffers for late\u2011season work and standardizing storm\u2011readiness checklists.\n\nFor funders and agency partners\n- Cost\u2011effectiveness: Year\u2011to\u2011date delivery is on budget; unit costs are steady despite storm delays due to bundled procurement and shared equipment.\n- Risk management: No safety incidents; adaptive scheduling prevented change orders.\n- Compliance and methods: All activities follow state Best Management Practices (BMPs), permit conditions, and our QA/QC protocols so results can be replicated by county conservation districts and state partners.\n\nWhat\u2019s next (through June 2025)\nWe are on track to reach 3,600 acres of buffers, 80 apprentices placed, and additional nitrogen reductions at priority sites in the Kentucky River and Tug Fork sub\u2011watersheds.

Your unwavering commitment is directly empowering thousands of young learners to discover the joy and power of reading. As we conclude March in the 2024\u20132025 school year, we're thrilled to share the significant progress made possible by your support.\n\nOur students in Atlanta, Detroit, Phoenix, Tulsa, Fresno, and across our network are making tangible strides, building essential literacy skills that will serve them for a lifetime.\n\n## Impact at a Glance\n\n*   **11,240 students served** (annual target 12,500; 90%) \u2014 more children receiving daily reading support.\n*   **62% met or exceeded growth goals** (up from 55% last year) \u2014 faster progress toward grade-level reading.\n*   **Average 26 tutoring sessions per student** (goal 24) \u2014 consistent practice drives stronger gains.\n*   **88 school sites across 14 cities** (vs. 75 last year) \u2014 expanded reach where waitlists were longest.\n*   **4,120 caregivers joined 312 family literacy workshops** \u2014 skills to support reading at home.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"[Link to student photo]\" alt=\"A smiling young student, Jayden, in a school library, holding a book open.\" width=\"300\"/>\n</center><br>\n\n## Jayden's Story: Finding His Voice Through Reading\n\nIn Detroit, Jayden, a third grader, spent years feeling self-conscious about his reading. He would often hide his books during silent reading time, worried about reading aloud to others. With consistent support from United Readers Network tutors over several months, Jayden\u2019s confidence and skills blossomed. Now, he's not only an eager reader but a mentor at home. \"I used to hide my book. Now I read to my little brother every night.\" Stories like Jayden's illustrate the profound impact your investment has on individual lives, turning reluctance into leadership.\n\n## Learning and Looking Ahead\n\nWhile our progress has been remarkable, the winter months presented a challenge: volunteer retention dipped by 12%, creating temporary gaps in afternoon tutoring sessions. We're actively addressing this by launching flexible, 45-minute \"micro-shifts,\" adding proactive text reminders, and piloting virtual tutoring options to backfill high-need hours. This adaptive approach ensures we maintain consistent support for every student.\n\n## What\u2019s Next\n\nWith 90% of our annual student goal already reached, we are on track for a record-breaking year. Our focus for the remainder of the school year is to expand our summer reading partnerships, ensuring continued literacy engagement through the break and preventing the \"summer slide\" for thousands more students.\n\nYour partnership is invaluable.

Through March, United Readers Network has provided consistent, caring reading support to students across 88 school sites\u2014and the results show what's possible when we invest in practice, people, and persistence.\n\nHere's what you helped accomplish this school year so far:\n\n---\n\n### **Your Impact Through March 2025**\n\n- **11,240 students served** (annual target 12,500; 90% reached) \u2014 more children with daily reading support across Atlanta, Detroit, Phoenix, Tulsa, and Fresno.\n\n- **62% met or exceeded growth goals** (up from 55% last year) \u2014 faster progress toward grade-level reading.\n\n- **Average 26 tutoring sessions per student** (goal 24) \u2014 consistent practice drives gains.\n\n- **88 school sites across 14 cities** (vs. 75 last year) \u2014 expanded reach where waitlists were longest.\n\n- **4,120 caregivers joined 312 family literacy workshops** \u2014 skills to support reading at home.\n\n**Mini-infographic:** \ud83d\udcc8 **62% of students met or exceeded reading growth goals**\u2014up 7 percentage points from last year.\n\n---\n\n### **Meet Jayden**\n\nJayden, a third grader in Detroit (pseudonym), started the year avoiding reading whenever he could. After six months of twice-weekly sessions with his volunteer tutor, he's choosing chapter books during free time. His teacher told us he now reads fluently and with expression\u2014something she hadn't seen in the fall.\n\n> *\"I used to hide my book. Now I read to my little brother every night.\"*  \n> **\u2014Jayden, 3rd grader, Detroit**\n\n---\n\n### **What We Learned: Keeping Volunteers Engaged**\n\nWinter volunteer retention dipped 12%, creating gaps in afternoon sessions\u2014especially during flu season and holiday breaks. This affected session consistency for about 340 students.\n\nWe launched flexible 45-minute micro-shifts, added text reminders, and piloted virtual tutoring to backfill high-need hours. Early data shows 18% improvement in February and March attendance, and we're refining the model for fall 2025.\n\n---\n\n### **What's Next**\n\nWe're on pace to serve **12,500 students by June** and close the year with at least 65% meeting growth targets. Between now and the end of the school year, we're focused on spring benchmark assessments, volunteer appreciation events in all 14 cities, and locking in school partnerships for fall 2025.\n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udcca Read the Full Report**\n\nSee detailed city breakdowns, student outcome data, financial highlights, and stories from every region.\n\n**[View the Complete 2024\u20132025 Mid-Year Impact Report \u2192](https://unitedreaders.org/impact/2025-syd)**\n\n*(Button styled in #004B87 background, white text)*\n\n---\n\n### **Help Us Grow**\n\nKnow someone who'd love to volunteer?
