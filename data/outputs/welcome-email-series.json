Gifts, no matter the size, directly power our critical work, allowing us to expand restoration projects and support more communities. For example, a gift of $35 can help us establish vital new marsh grasses that protect kilometers of shoreline.\n\nWe understand that financial support is just one way to contribute. If now is not the right time for a gift, we encourage you to continue engaging with us in other ways. Share our stories on social media, attend our events, or simply spread the word about the importance of coastal resilience.

In a working marsh where small-boat captains navigate narrow cuts, our crews planted native grasses and removed storm debris.

          "The progression is strategically sound: welcome \u2192 proof \u2192 engagement \u2192 optional giving, with each email building naturally on the last",

          "Email 3 could benefit from one more sentence acknowledging geographic spread\u2014'opportunities available across all five Gulf states' or similar\u2014to reinforce regional scope for subscribers outside Louisiana"
