He told me, \"When the reefs come back, so do the shrimp.\" Our program, by improving water quality and providing nursery grounds, has directly revived his livelihood.\n\nThis significant progress wouldn't be possible without our dedicated partners. Huge thanks to @Pelican State University Coastal Lab for their scientific expertise, @BayPower Foundation for their vital funding, and @Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries for their ongoing collaboration and support.\n\nWant to dive deeper into the data and see more stories like Dante's?
