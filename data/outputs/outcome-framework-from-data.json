  "prompt_text": "You are an evaluation specialist helping a nonprofit program manager create a practical Outcome Framework. Transform the information provided below into a structured, realistic framework aligned with nonprofit evaluation best practices and small-team capacity.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR MODE\n- QUICK START (recommended for beginners): If you only have brief notes or limited data, I will produce a lean framework with clear placeholders, a starter indicator set, and a simple 90-day data plan.\n- FULL BUILD (advanced): If you have a logic model and some data, I will produce the complete framework with detailed indicators, baselines/targets, and a full data plan.\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN: Paste Your Information Below\nRequired (paste what you have; raw snippets are okay):\n- Program name and 2\u20134 sentence description\n- Target population and geography\n- Timeframe (program duration and reporting cycles)\n- Logic model or theory of change (activities \u2192 outputs \u2192 outcomes). If none, describe what you do and the changes you expect.\n- Available data: surveys, attendance, assessments, admin data, feedback, baseline numbers, funder reports (paste raw data or summaries)\n\nOptional (helpful):\n- Funder requirements (indicators, disaggregation, deadlines)\n- Staff capacity for data (hours/week, tools in use)\n- Data systems (spreadsheets, CRM, case notes)\n- Equity priorities (e.g., focus on specific subgroups)\n\nIf information is missing: I will flag gaps, propose conservative assumptions, and suggest pragmatic workarounds. No data will be invented; placeholders will be clearly labeled.\n\nEXAMPLES OF ACCEPTABLE INPUT\n- \u201cAttendance CSV fields: ID, session_date, hours, site.\u201d\n- \u201cSurvey Q3: \u2018I know 3 ways to find a living-wage job\u2019 (1\u20135 Likert). Pre: n=42 mean=2.6; Post: n=37 mean=3.9.\u201d\n- \u201cFunder asks for quarterly report on #served, % gainful employment within 6 months, and stories.\u201d\n- \u201cNo baseline on retention; we can pull last year\u2019s rosters.\u201d\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (8 sections in this order)\n1) Program Snapshot (100\u2013150 words)\n- Include: mission/focus, target population, geography, timeframe, brief logic model (activities \u2192 outputs \u2192 outcomes), and any funder requirements.\n\n2) Outcomes (Short 0\u201312 mo; Medium 1\u20133 yrs; Long 3+ yrs)\n- Define 2\u20134 outcomes per tier using concrete, measurable language (avoid vague verbs).\n- For each outcome, note attribution vs. contribution.\n- List the indicator names (3\u20135 per outcome). Do not include indicator details here\u2014details go in Section 3.\n\n3) Indicators Detail Table (primary location for indicator specs)\nFor each indicator listed in Section 2, provide:\n- Indicator name\n- Operational definition (exact measure, numerator/denominator if applicable)\n- Data source (survey, records, observation, interview, admin dataset)\n- Collection method (e.g., online form, SMS, file pull)\n- Frequency (e.g., per session, monthly, quarterly, pre/post, annually)\n- Disaggregation (race/ethnicity, gender, age, location, income, language\u2014adapt to context)\n- Responsible role (data owner)\nTable format:\n| Indicator | Definition | Source | Method | Frequency | Disaggregation | Owner |\n\n4) Outputs (50\u2013100 words)\n- List 3\u20135 core outputs (service volumes) with simple counts to contextualize outcomes.\n- Clearly label these as OUTPUTS (activities/throughput), not outcomes.\n\n5) Baselines & Targets (100\u2013150 words)\n- Derive baselines from provided data; if missing, state \u201cNo current baseline\u201d and describe how to establish one in the first cycle.\n- Set realistic annual targets with brief rationale (capacity, prior trends, comparison points).\n- Note confidence and data quality limits.\n\n6) Data Collection Plan (150\u2013200 words)\n- Instruments: specify concrete tools (e.g., 6-item pre/post, attendance export, brief exit interview guide).\n- Low-burden methods: align to staff capacity and participant burden.\n- Cadence: when and how often each source is collected.\n- Storage/management: where data lives (spreadsheet/CRM), file naming, access, retention.\n- Estimated staff time per task (e.g., 1\u20132 hrs/month data entry; 2 hrs/quarter analysis).\n- Gaps & workarounds: note immediate pragmatic steps until ideal systems are in place.\n\n7) Learning Questions, Assumptions, Ethics (100\u2013150 words)\n- 2\u20133 learning/evaluation questions to guide improvement.\n- Key assumptions and external factors/risks.\n- Data ethics: consent, privacy, cultural relevance, and minimizing participant burden.\n- Mini-glossary (3\u20135 brief definitions for any technical terms used).\n\n8) Review & Use (\u224850 words)\n- Who reviews, when (recommend annual review), and how findings will inform program decisions, equity checks, and funder reporting.\n\nQUALITY STANDARDS\nPrioritize:\n- Meaningful, equity-aware indicators over easy-to-count vanity metrics\n- Feasibility for small teams; low participant burden\n- Tight alignment with the logic model and funder requirements\n- Clear attribution vs. contribution statements\nAvoid:\n- Jargon without definitions; vague verbs without measures\n- Overpromising causation where only contribution is plausible\n- Collecting data you won\u2019t analyze or use\n\nFORMATTING\n- Total length: 900\u20131,200 words plus one indicators table\n- Tone: [SELECT ONE: FORMAL (grant/report-ready, precise, neutral) | WARM (community-friendly, strengths-based) | CASUAL (internal draft, concise bullets)]\n- Output format: [SELECT ONE: Markdown headings + one markdown table | Plain text bullets + ASCII table]\n- Prepared by: [PROGRAM MANAGER NAME, TITLE]\n- Audience: [internal team / board / funders / community]\n- Review cycle: Annually each [MONTH]\n\nHANDLING INCOMPLETE INFORMATION\n- If logic model is missing: infer a minimal draft based on activities and intended changes; mark as \u201cDraft \u2013 validate with team.\u201d\n- If baselines are missing: propose a 60\u201390 day plan to establish them and set provisional targets (e.g., \u201cMaintain then +10% improvement after baseline is established\u201d).\n- If funder metrics conflict with meaningful indicators: include both; label funder-required vs. mission-critical.\n- Clearly mark all assumptions; suggest specific next steps to replace assumptions with data.\n\nABBREVIATED EXAMPLE (for reference)\nProgram Snapshot: Youth Leadership Academy serves 60 low-income high school students in Metro City via weekly workshops and mentoring (Sept\u2013June). Logic model: workshops + mentoring \u2192 increased civic knowledge and leadership skills \u2192 students take leadership roles \u2192 stronger youth voice in local decisions. Funder requires quarterly reporting on participation and skill gains.\n\nShort-term Outcome: Students increase civic knowledge and leadership skills (contribution).\nIndicator names: Civic knowledge score (pre/post); Leadership skills self-rating; Qualitative reflections (exit interviews).\n\nIndicators Detail Table (excerpt):\n| Indicator | Definition | Source | Method | Frequency | Disaggregation | Owner |\n| Civic knowledge score | Mean change on 8-item test (0\u20138) | Pre/post test | In-session paper form | Pre & Post | Race/ethnicity, gender, grade, school | Program Coordinator |\n| Leadership skills self-rating | Mean change on 5-item 1\u20135 scale | Survey | Mobile-friendly form | Pre & Post | Same as above | Data Fellow |\n| Qualitative reflections | Thematic codes of leadership growth | Exit interviews | 10-min semi-structured | End-of-program | Same as above | Volunteer Lead |\n\nNOW: Paste your program information below (or say \u201cQuick Start\u201d with brief notes), and I will produce your tailored Outcome Framework.",

This serves as the benchmark for measuring improvement.\n*   **Employment Rate:** No current baseline for our explicit target population (unemployed young adults in specific neighborhoods) with existing tech skills. Assume 0% employment in tech-related roles at program entry.\n*   **Perceived Skill Improvement/Self-Efficacy, Job Retention, Salary:** No baseline data available as the program is new. These will be established with the first cohort's post-workshop and follow-up data.\n\n**Targets (Annual for year 1 pilot):**\n*   **Digital/Technical Skills Assessment Score:** Achieve a minimum 50% relative increase in mean score from pre-test to post-test (Target: mean post-score of 6.3/15 or higher). *Rationale: A 50% improvement indicates significant skill acquisition given the foundational nature of the workshops.*\n*   **Workshop Competency Completion Rate:** 80% of enrolled participants complete all core workshop modules. *Rationale: Reflects successful engagement and delivery, balancing rigor with participant challenges.*\n*   **Job Search Self-Efficacy Score:** Achieve a mean rating of 4.0/5 or higher on job search confidence post-workshop. *Rationale: A strong indicator of participant readiness for the job market.*\n*   **Employment Rate in Tech-Related Roles (6-month post-program):** 30% of workshop completers secure employment in tech-related or digitally-enabled roles within six months. *Rationale: Ambitious for a pilot, considering the unemployed target, but achievable given current demand for entry-level tech skills.*\n\n**Confidence/Data Quality Limits:** Baseline for a new program means initial targets are estimates. Data quality for employment and salary relies on participant self-report in follow-ups, which may have some reporting bias or incomplete information. We will cross-reference where possible (e.g., LinkedIn profiles).\n\n---\n\n**6) Data Collection Plan**\n\n**Instruments:**\n*   **Participant Intake Form:** Standardized Google Form for demographic and pre-program employment/education data.\n*   **Attendance Records:** Google Sheet template (shared with trainers) for weekly session check-ins using `participant_ID`, `session_date`, `attended`.\n*   **Pre/Post Skills Assessment:** 15-item multiple-choice/short answer survey administered via SurveyMonkey (link provided in-session).\n*   **Participant Feedback Survey:** 5-7 Likert scale and 2-3 open-ended questions administered via SurveyMonkey at the end of the 8-week workshop.\n*   **Career Counseling Logs:** Standardized MS Word template completed by the Career Counselor per session.\n*   **Job Placement Tracking:** Google Sheet for follow-up call/email notes post-program. Scripted questions to ensure consistency (e.g., \"Are you currently employed? If yes, what is your role and company? What is your starting salary/range?\").\n*   **Networking Event Sign-in Sheet:** Physical sign-in or simple Google Form for event attendance.\n\n**Low-burden methods:** Online surveys are preferred for participants. Staff data entry is minimized through templated sheets and existing systems. Follow-up calls will be brief and scheduled at participant convenience.\n\n**Cadence:**\n*   **Participant Intake:** Program entry.\n*   **Attendance:** Weekly, per session.\n*   **Pre-Skills Assessment:** First session of 8-week workshop.\n*   **Post-Skills Assessment & Feedback Survey:** Final session of 8-week workshop.\n*   **Career Counseling Logs:** After each session.\n*   **Job Placement Tracking:** 3-month and 6-month follow-ups post-workshop for all completers.\n*   **Networking Events:** At each event.\n\n**Storage/Management:**\nAll data (Google Sheets, SurveyMonkey exports, Word docs) will be stored on a secure, cloud-based shared drive (e.g., Google Drive for Nonprofits). Files will be organized by `[Cohort Name]_[Data Type]_[Date]`. Access limited to Program Coordinator and approved Intern. Data will be retained per funder/organizational policy (e.g., 5 years).\n\n**Estimated Staff Time:**\n*   Program Coordinator: ~3-4 hrs/week for data oversight, analysis preparation, and follow-ups. ~5 hrs/quarter for reporting.\n*   Volunteer Intern: ~3 hrs/week for data entry (attendance, intake forms), survey distribution, and basic file organization.\n\n**Gaps & Workarounds:**\n*   **Salary data:** Relying on self-report. Workaround: Emphasize confidentiality; provide ranges if exact numbers are uncomfortable. Cross-reference with publicly available salary data for similar roles.\n*   **Long-term outcomes:** No current mechanism for 1+ year follow-up. Workaround: Prioritize robust 6-month follow-up. Develop a plan for an annual alumni survey (low-frequency, incentive-based) for Year 2 and beyond, potentially leveraging social media/LinkedIn for contact. This needs to be a future addition.\n\n---\n\n**7) Learning Questions, Assumptions, Ethics**\n\n**Learning Questions:**\n1.  Which specific workshop modules (data entry, Python, digital job search) correlate most strongly with participants' post-program employment success in tech-related roles?\n2.  Are there any significant disparities in skill acquisition or employment outcomes for certain demographic groups (race/ethnicity, gender, age) that require program adaptation?\n3.  How can we better integrate career counseling and networking opportunities to maximize job placement rates and long-term career growth for participants?\n\n**Assumptions & External Factors/Risks:**\n*   **Assumption:** The 8-week workshop duration is sufficient to equip participants with entry-level skills marketable in Innovation City's tech sector.\n*   **Assumption:** Participants have the foundational literacy and motivation to engage with technical training.\n*   **External Factor/Risk:** Local tech job market fluctuations (e.g., economic downturns, changes in hiring needs) could impact job placement rates regardless of participant skill levels.\n*   **External Factor/Risk:** Access to reliable internet and personal computing devices outside of workshops could impact participant practice and job search capabilities.\n\n**Data Ethics:**\n*   **Consent:** Clear, informed consent will be obtained from all participants for data collection, including purpose, confidentiality, and ability to withdraw. Re-consent for follow-up data will be sought.\n*   **Privacy:** All personal data will be anonymized or aggregated for reporting. Individual identifiers will be kept separate and secure.\n*   **Cultural Relevance:** Surveys and interview questions will be reviewed for cultural sensitivity and respectful language. Follow-up communication will be flexible and participant-centered.\n*   **Minimizing Participant Burden:** Data collection will be as brief and infrequent as possible, integrated into the program flow, and clearly explained. Follow-ups will respect participant time.\n\n**Mini-Glossary:**\n*   **Digital Literacy:** The ability to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information using digital technologies.\n*   **Self-Efficacy:** A person's belief in their capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments.\n*   **Tech-Related Roles:** Jobs requiring significant use of digital tools and technology, ranging from data entry and technical support to basic coding and digital marketing.\n*   **Attribution:** The extent to which an observed change can be linked directly to the program's activities.\n*   **Contribution:** The program's part in a broader set of factors leading to an outcome.\n\n---\n\n**8) Review & Use**\n\nThe program team, led by the Program Manager, will review this framework and the collected data annually each October. Findings will directly inform program improvements, guide resource allocation, identify areas for deeper equity analysis, and fulfill funder reporting requirements, ensuring the program remains responsive and effective.",

This ongoing initiative, operating in 6-month cycles per participant cohort, delivers vocational training, job search assistance, and crucial soft skills development. The program's core logic model posits that these activities lead to increased job readiness and self-efficacy (short-term outcomes), culminating in gainful and sustained employment, and ultimately, improved economic self-sufficiency (medium/long-term outcomes). Funders require quarterly reporting on the number of participants served and the percentage achieving gainful employment within six months of program completion.\n\n### 2) Outcomes\n\n**Short-term (0\u201312 months):**\n*   **Outcome 1:** Participants increase their job readiness skills and self-efficacy. (Contribution)\n    *   Indicator names: Job readiness skills confidence score (pre/post); Self-efficacy for employment score (pre/post); Completion rate of core workshops.\n*   **Outcome 2:** Participants engage actively in job search and career development activities. (Contribution)\n    *   Indicator names: Number of job applications submitted; Participation in mock interviews; Completion of resume reviews.\n\n**Medium-term (1\u20133 years):**\n*   **Outcome 3:** Participants secure stable, gainful employment. (Attribution)\n    *   Indicator names: Percentage employed within 6 months of program completion; Average hourly wage at placement; Retention in employment at 6 months.\n\n**Long-term (3+ years):**\n*   **Outcome 4:** Participants achieve improved economic self-sufficiency. (Contribution)\n    *   Indicator names: Percentage reducing reliance on public assistance (post-program); Median household income increase (post-program).\n\n### 3) Indicators Detail Table\n\n|

(pre/post):**\n    *   **Baseline:** Establish during the first 60-90 days, utilizing intake survey data (estimated average around 3.0/5.0).\n    *   **Target (Year 1):** Achieve a 1.0-point average increase from pre- to post-program score for 70% of participants.\n*   **Self-efficacy for employment score (pre/post):**\n    *   **Baseline:** Establish during the first 60-90 days, utilizing intake survey data (estimated average around 3.2/5.0).\n    *   **Target (Year 1):** Achieve a 0.8-point average increase from pre- to post-program score for 65% of participants.\n*   **Percentage employed within 6 months:**\n    *   **Baseline:** No current baseline; estimate 40% based on anecdotal evidence for the first cycle.\n    *   **Target (Year 1):** Achieve 55% gainful employment within 6 months for program completers. (Rationale: Account for initial program setup complexities and then aim for gradual improvement.)\n*   **Completion rate of core workshops:**\n    *   **Baseline:** No current baseline; estimate 75% based on initial program design.\n    *   **Target (Year 1):** Maintain 80% completion rate for core workshops. (Rationale: Indicates strong program engagement and delivery.)\n\n**Confidence and Data Quality Limits:** Initial targets are provisional due to a lack of historical baseline data. Data quality will improve as collection processes are standardized and staff become more proficient. Data on long-term outcomes (e.g., reduced public assistance reliance) are particularly challenging to attribute and collect reliably from participants after program completion; targets will be set conservatively.\n\n### 6) Data Collection Plan\n\n*   **Instruments:**\n    *   **Intake/Exit Survey:** Will use a 6-item Likert scale pre/post survey for job readiness and self-efficacy, administered electronically (e.g., Google Forms) for efficiency, with paper option for accessibility.\n    *   **Attendance Tracking:** Existing spreadsheet for vocational training and workshop attendance. Will add fields for activity specific outcomes (e.g., Mock Interview Yes/No, Resume Review Yes/No).\n    *   **Post-Program Follow-up:** Brief 5-item online survey or phone interview at 3/6/12 months post-program for employment status, wage, and public assistance questions.\n    *   **Participant Check-in Form:** Simple paper or digital form for participants to self-report job applications submitted, collected during weekly check-ins.\n*   **Low-burden methods:** Prioritize online forms, existing administrative tools (spreadsheets), and brief interactions to minimize participant and staff burden. Surveys are short and focused.\n*   **Cadence:**\n    *   **Intake Survey:** Upon enrollment.\n    *   **Exit Survey:** Upon program completion (approx. 6 months).\n    *   **Attendance/Service Logs:** Per session/activity by instructor/Program Coordinator.\n    *   **Job Application Check-ins:** Weekly/Bi-weekly.\n    *   **Post-Program Follow-up:** 3, 6, and 12-month intervals post-completion.\n*   **Storage/Management:** All data will be stored in password-protected Google Sheets accessible only to authorized staff. Files will be named consistently (e.g., \"WPP_CohortA_Attendance_2023.xlsx\", \"WPP_2023_IntakeExitSurveyData.xlsx\"). A basic data dictionary will be maintained.\n*   **Estimated staff time:**\n    *   Program Coordinator: 3-4 hours/week for data entry, cleaning, and survey administration.\n    *   Executive Director: 1 hour/quarter for reviewing funder reports and outcome summaries.\n*   **Gaps & Workarounds:**\n    *   No robust CRM currently. Google Sheets will serve as the primary data system; invest in CRM exploration in Year 2.\n    *   Long-term follow-up can be challenging. Will incentivize survey completion with small gift cards to improve response rates.\n\n### 7) Learning Questions, Assumptions, Ethics\n\n*   **Learning Questions:**\n    1.  Which specific vocational training pathways lead to the highest rates of sustained employment for participants from marginalized communities?\n    2.  What program elements (e.g., specific soft skills workshops, intensity of coaching) are most correlated with increased job readiness self-efficacy?\n*   **Assumptions:**\n    *   Participants are motivated to secure employment and actively engage with program components.\n    *   Local job market conditions will remain stable enough to absorb program graduates.\n    *   Funding will remain consistent, supporting continued program delivery.\n    *   Participants will accurately self-report employment status and income changes.\n*   **Data Ethics:**\n    *   Obtain informed consent from all participants for data collection and use for program evaluation.\n    *   Ensure data anonymization or pseudonymization where appropriate to protect privacy.\n    *   Disaggregate data by race/ethnicity and income to identify and address potential inequities in outcomes, ensuring culturally sensitive communication and data collection.\n    *   Minimize participant burden by keeping surveys brief and scheduling follow-ups conveniently.\n*   **Mini-glossary:**\n    *   **Gainful Employment:** Full-time (30+ hours/week) paid employment at or above the living wage for Springfield County.\n    *   **Self-efficacy:** An individual's belief in their capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments.\n    *   **Attribution:** The extent to which an outcome can be directly linked to the program's efforts.\n    *   **Contribution:** The program's role in achieving outcomes, often in combination with other factors.\n\n### 8) Review & Use\n\nThe Program Coordinator and Executive Director will review findings annually each March at an internal program assessment meeting. This review will inform programmatic adjustments, staff training needs, equitable service delivery, and be used for funder reporting and communication with the board.",

(Rationale: Previous cohort achieved 4.2 with N=92, aiming for further improvement due to curriculum refinement and strong mentor engagement.)\n**Job Search Confidence:**\n*   **Baseline:** 2.3 (from n=85 pre-program survey)\n*   **Annual Target:** Increase mean score to 4.2 by end of program for 75% of participants. (Rationale: Previous cohort achieved 4.0, target is ambitious but attainable with focused career counseling.)\n**Rate of Gainful Employment (6 months post-program):**\n*   **Baseline:** 45% (from n=60 previous cohort 6-month follow-up)\n*   **Annual Target:** Achieve 55% gainful employment (20+ hrs/week at local living wage) within 6 months of program completion. (Rationale: This is a key funder metric. A 10-percentage point increase is ambitious but aligns with improved program structure and employer partnerships.)\n**Median Hourly Wage:**\n*   **Baseline:** $17.50 (from n=60 previous cohort employed participants)\n*   **Annual Target:** Median hourly wage of $18.50 for employed participants within 6 months. (Rationale: Reflects a modest but meaningful increase, acknowledging local living wage goals and market conditions.)\n\nConfidence in baselines is moderate given sample sizes of prior cohorts; these targets will be reviewed and adjusted after the first full year of tracking with the new framework. Data quality for current baselines is good as they come from structured surveys.\n\n### 6) Data Collection Plan\n\n**Instruments:**\n*   **Pre-Post Surveys:** 5-7 minute SurveyMonkey link (6-item for digital comfort, 4-item for job search confidence, 3-item for digital tool use post-program, 2-item for networking comfort).\n*   **6-Month Follow-up Survey:** 10-minute SurveyMonkey link (including employment status, hourly wage, financial stability, digital skill relevance, job applications).\n*   **Attendance Export:** Google Sheets export, structured for easy analysis of workshops and employer events.\n*   **Mentorship Session Summary:** CRM report on completed sessions and topics.\n*   **Certification Records:** Simple Google Sheet for manual entry of completed certifications.\n*   **Success Stories:** Brief qualitative notes and direct participant quotes collected via informal feedback and optional exit interviews (3-5 questions).\n*   **12-Month Follow-up Survey:** (To be developed) A streamlined SurveyMonkey link for employment retention and sustained digital tool use.\n\n**Low-Burden Methods:** All participant surveys are online, mobile-friendly, and kept concise (under 10 minutes). Data entry from attendance and mentorship logs will be automated where possible or conducted by the Program Coordinator with designated time.\n\n**Cadence:**\n*   **Pre-program surveys:** Administered during participant onboarding.\n*   **Post-program exit surveys:** Administered during the last week of the 6-month program.\n*   **6-Month Follow-up surveys:** Administered 6 months after program completion for each participant.\n*   **Attendance Records:** Updated weekly by Program Coordinator; exported monthly.\n*   **Mentorship Logs:** Updated by Mentorship Coordinator after each session; summarized monthly.\n*   **Certification Records:** Updated monthly as certificates are obtained.\n*   **Employer Connect Attendance:** Updated after each event.\n*   **Qualitative Stories:** Ongoing collection through program duration, formalized quarterly.\n*   **12-Month Follow-up Survey:** To be implemented for participants completing the program from Q3 onward, administered 12 months post-program.\n\n**Storage/Management:**\n*   Raw survey data: Stored on SurveyMonkey, exported to Google Drive (restricted access) quarterly.\n*   Attendance, Certification, Employer Event: Dedicated Google Sheets in shared Drive, named `YEDL_CohortX_Attendance_YYYYMM.csv`, `YEDL_CohortX_Certifications_YYYYMM.xlsx`.\n*   CRM data: Stored within the CRM, reports exported to Google Drive quarterly.\n*   Qualitative stories: Google Doc template `YEDL_CohortX_Stories_YYYYQ.docx` in shared Drive.\n*   All data files accessible only by Program Coordinator and Senior Program Manager. Retention policy: 7 years.\n\n**Estimated Staff Time (per task, average):**\n*   Program Coordinator: 10 hrs/month (survey management, data export/entry, basic tabulation); 5 hrs/quarter (funder reporting data compilation); 4 hrs/quarter (qualitative story collection/summarization); 5 hrs/month (general data oversight).\n*   Mentorship Coordinator: 2 hrs/week (session log entry into CRM).\n*   Career Counselor: 0 hrs (existing qualitative notes are not structured for formal data entry in this plan due to burden).\n\n**Gaps & Workarounds:**\n*   **No immediate 12-month follow-up data:** Will implement a new 12-month follow-up survey for future cohorts to establish Employment Retention Rate at 12 months.\n*   **Limited disaggregation for qualitative notes:** Counselor notes are not easily disagreggated due to privacy and unstructured format, current plan focuses on quantitative disaggregation.\n*   **Financial stability baseline:** No prior data on self-reported financial stability; the first 6-month follow-up survey will establish this baseline.\n\n### 7) Learning Questions, Assumptions, Ethics\n\n**Learning Questions:**\n*   How do participants' initial digital skill levels correlate with their post-program employment outcomes, and do particular workshop modules have a stronger impact?\n*   What are the primary barriers to sustained employment for YEDL graduates within 12 months, and how can the program strengthen its post-placement support?\n*   Are there significant differences in program outcomes (e.g., employment rates, wage gains) across different subgroups (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, neighborhood) and if so, what programmatic adjustments might address these disparities?\n\n**Assumptions & External Factors/Risks:**\n*   **Assumption:** Participants have basic digital access (device, internet) outside the program or can access community resources.\n*   **Assumption:** The local job market continues to have demand for digitally skilled entry-level workers.\n*   **External Factor/Risk:** Economic downturns or significant changes in the local job market could impact employment outcomes regardless of skill development.\n*   **External Factor/Risk:** Individual participant commitment and external life circumstances (e.g., housing, childcare, health) can significantly influence participation and outcomes.\n\n**Data Ethics:**\n*   **Consent:** Explicit informed consent will be obtained from all participants for data collection and use for program evaluation and reporting. They will understand their right to opt-out.\n*   **Privacy:** All personal identifiers will be de-identified or aggregated for external reporting. Raw data will be stored securely with restricted access. Qualitative data will be anonymized unless explicit consent for direct quotes/stories is obtained.\n*   **Cultural Relevance:** Survey language will be reviewed for clarity and cultural appropriateness. Program staff will be trained to collect data sensitively.\n*   **Minimizing Participant Burden:** Surveys are designed to be brief and relevant, respecting participants' time. Follow-up surveys will offer incentives (e.g., small gift cards) to encourage participation.\n\n**Mini-Glossary:**\n*   **Gainful Employment:** Defined as working 20+ hours per week at or above the local living wage.\n*   **Digital Skill Comfort Score:** An aggregated average of self-rated comfort levels across various digital tools.\n*   **Job Search Self-Efficacy:** A participant's belief in their ability to successfully execute job search behaviors.\n*   **Attribution:** The extent to which an observed change can be attributed specifically to the program's interventions.\n*   **Contribution:** The extent to which the program's interventions played a role alongside other factors in producing an observed change.\n\n### 8) Review & Use\n\nThis framework will be reviewed annually each July by the internal program team and Senior Program Manager. Findings will inform program refinements, identify areas for equity-focused intervention, optimize resource allocation, and ensure compliance with funder reporting requirements.",
