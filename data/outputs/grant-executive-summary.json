Key partners include Oakland Adult & Career Education, Peralta Colleges, and local employers like Durable Goods Co. and FreshGrocer.\n\n**Request**\nWe request **$45,000** from the Larkin Family Foundation to support the English to Employment (E2E) workforce ESOL and job placement program from July 2025 \u2013 June 2026. The total program budget is $120,000, with $40,000 confirmed from the City of Oakland Workforce Board, $20,000 from individual donors, and $5,000 in-kind classroom space. The estimated per-participant cost is $2,400.\n\n**Outcomes**\nE2E aims to serve 50 adults, with **80% completing 60+ hours of instruction** within 6 months. We target **65% obtaining new or better employment** within 6 months, achieving a median starting wage of **$22/hour**, and 75% retaining employment at 90 days.\n\n**Evidence & Evaluation**\nOur approach blends evidence-based contextualized ESOL with sector-based placement. A prior cohort (2024) saw a 70% job placement rate and an average wage gain of $3.75/hour. Results will be tracked through pre/post CASAS language assessments, coaching case notes, employer verification, and 30/90-day follow-up surveys in Spanish and Mam.\n\n**Organizational Capacity**\nFruitvale Community Bridge, founded in 2016, has served 1,800 immigrants through education, legal navigation, and benefits access. Our 5 program staff are bilingual and include TESOL-certified and credentialed instructors and career coaches. We maintain balanced budgets, deliver on-time reporting for city contracts, and have 2.5 months of operating reserves.\n\n**Funder Fit**\nThis program directly aligns with the Larkin Family Foundation\u2019s commitment to **economic mobility** and **immigrant and refugee integration**.\n\n**Equity & Community Voice**\nE2E centers Latinx and Indigenous newcomers facing language, documentation, and discrimination barriers, offering services regardless of immigration status. Curriculum topics and class times are set through quarterly participant councils and SMS polls, with classes offered in Spanish and Mam, an evening schedule near transit lines, and provision of childcare and transit vouchers.\n\n**Timeline**\nMonths 1\u20132: recruit and enroll 50 participants; Months 3\u20138: instruction and certifications; Month 6: employer hiring fair; Month 9: 90-day employment follow-ups; Month 12: final evaluation and report.\n\n**Sustainability**\nThe E2E program will be sustained through City workforce contract renewals, employer sponsorships, individual donors, and alignment with state Adult Education (WIOA) funding.\n\n**Contact**\n[CONTACT NAME, TITLE, EMAIL, PHONE]",

Forty percent of tested stream miles are impaired for aquatic life (PA DEP 2024), 18% of private wells exceed the 10 mg/L nitrate standard, and agriculture is identified as the leading sediment source. This directly harms farm productivity, raises household health risks, and reduces vital recreation and tourism revenues.\n\n**Solution**\nThe Allegheny Watershed Conservancy\u2019s Healthy Streams Initiative will implement on-farm best management practices (BMPs) to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution. Serving 120 family farms across Fayette and Greene Counties (PA) and Monongalia County (WV), this program utilizes farm assessments, cost-share grants, technical assistance, and quarterly water quality monitoring. Key partners include Penn State Extension, County Conservation Districts, the WVU Water Research Institute, and local Trout Unlimited chapters.\n\n**Request**\nWe request **$250,000** from the Appalachian Stewardship Foundation for the implementation of on-farm best management practices to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution during the January\u2013December 2026 grant period. The total project budget is $850,000, with $300,000 in USDA NRCS EQIP cost-share, $150,000 from county conservation funds, $50,000 from private donors, and $25,000 in-kind lab analysis already confirmed. The estimated per-participant cost is $7,083.\n\n**Outcomes**\nWithin 12 months, the Initiative will enroll 120 farms, install **280 BMP projects**, reduce nitrogen loads by **75,000 lbs** and sediment by **1,500 tons annually**, and document a 15% improvement in macroinvertebrate scores at 8 monitoring sites.\n\n**Evidence & Evaluation**\nResearch from the USDA and Chesapeake Bay Program substantiates the efficacy of BMPs in reducing nutrient and sediment loads; a 2023 pilot with 35 farms demonstrated a 20% reduction in downstream nitrate levels. Results will be tracked through quarterly grab samples, continuous sensors, GIS-tracked BMP installations, farmer adoption surveys, and independent laboratory verification.\n\n**Organizational Capacity**\nEstablished in 2003, the Allegheny Watershed Conservancy has protected 22,000 acres and restored 65 stream miles, operating with a staff of 24, including 8 certified conservation planners. Our Program Director is a Professional Engineer, our board includes hydrologists and farmers, and we maintain strong fiscal health with clean single audits for six consecutive years and a 5-month operating reserve.\n\n**Funder Fit**\nThis Initiative directly delivers measurable water quality improvements and strengthens rural community resilience, aligning with the Appalachian Stewardship Foundation\u2019s priorities.\n\n**Equity & Community Voice**\nCost-share opportunities prioritize small and historically underserved producers, with outreach conducted through local Grange halls and farm bureaus, and Spanish-language materials provided for dairy workers. Project sites were selected with a farmer advisory group and input from township listening sessions.\n\n**Timeline**\nQ1: site assessments and contracts finalized; Q2\u2013Q3: BMP installation; Q3: mid-year monitoring report; Q4: post-installation sampling and final report.\n\n**Sustainability**\nPost-grant sustainability is ensured through ongoing USDA NRCS and state agriculture funding, a revolving cost-share fund from producer repayments, and landowner maintenance agreements spanning 10+ years.\n\n**Contact**\nFor questions, please contact [CONTACT NAME, TITLE, EMAIL, PHONE].",

Families with minor children, particularly Black and Latino single-mother households, are disproportionately affected; a median CalWORKs grant ($1,233 for a family of three) falls far short of the average $2,781/month 2-bedroom rent. Shelter entry disrupts work, schooling, and can deepen trauma, increasing the time families remain unhoused.\n\n**Solution**\nThe Family Diversion & Stability Initiative aims to prevent shelter entry for **1,200 families** at imminent risk of homelessness in Los Angeles County's SPAs 2, 4, and 6. Through diversion screening at LAHSA Coordinated Entry, mediation with landlords/family, flexible financial assistance, and 1:1 housing stabilization coaching, we stop a shelter stay before it starts. Key partners include DPSS CalWORKs offices, Neighborhood Legal Services, and school district McKinney-Vento liaisons.\n\n**Request**\nMetro Family Housing Partnership requests **$1,500,000** from the Conrad N.

The estimated per-participant cost is $5,417 per family.\n\n**Outcomes**\nWe project diverting **1,200 families** from shelter entry, with **85% remaining stably housed at 6 months** and 70% sustaining housing at 12 months. Our goal is to maintain the average assistance per family under $2,200 and reduce the average time to resolution to 10 days.\n\n**Evidence & Evaluation**\nProven diversion models in King County and LA County demonstrate 70\u201380% housing retention. Metro Family Housing Partnership's 2023 pilot successfully diverted 410 families, achieving an **83% 6-month stability rate**. Results will be meticulously tracked via HMIS data, case records, landlord verification, and 6- and 12-month follow-up surveys, reviewed quarterly.\n\n**Organizational Capacity**\nEstablished in 1988, Metro Family Housing Partnership served 18,000 people last year and boasts 220 staff and a countywide footprint. Our Housing Stabilization team is led by an LCSW, supported by multilingual navigators and a robust HMIS data team. We maintain unmodified audits for 10 years and possess 6-month operating reserves.\n\n**Funder Fit**\nThis Initiative directly addresses family homelessness by resolving crises upstream, aligning with the Conrad N.

The total program budget is $6,500,000, leveraging $3,000,000 in Measure H funding, $1,250,000 from private donors/corporate partners, and $500,000 in-kind; estimated cost is $5,417 per family.\n\nOutcomes\nWe will **divert 1,200 families** from shelter, with **85% stably housed at 6 months** and 70% sustaining housing at 12 months. We will keep average assistance per family under $2,200 and **reduce average time to resolution to 10 days**. We will disaggregate results by SPA and race/ethnicity.\n\nEvidence & Evaluation\nDiversion models in King County and Los Angeles County show 70\u201380% housing retention with flexible assistance; our 2023 pilot diverted 410 families with 83% six\u2011month stability. We will track outcomes via the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), case records, landlord verification, and 6- and 12\u2011month surveys, with quarterly dashboard reviews.\n\nOrganizational Capacity\nFounded in 1988, we served 18,000 people last year across prevention, shelter, and housing with 220 staff and a countywide footprint. A licensed clinical social worker leads our Housing Stabilization team, supported by multilingual navigators and an HMIS data unit; audits have been unmodified for 10 years with six months of operating reserves.\n\nFunder Fit\nThis Initiative advances family homelessness prevention through upstream prevention, aligning with Hilton\u2019s focus on solutions that keep families housed.\n\nEquity & Community Voice\nWe target SPAs with the highest rates of Black family homelessness and deliver culturally responsive services; flexible aid also removes barriers for undocumented caregivers. A parent advisory council and McKinney\u2011Vento liaisons shaped program design; services include evening hours, English/Spanish support, childcare, and transit/Lyft assistance.\n\nTimeline\nMonths 1\u20133: hire and train 12 diversion specialists; Months 4\u201324: operate countywide; Month 12: midpoint evaluation; Month 24: final report and knowledge\u2011sharing brief.\n\nSustainability\nPost\u2011grant funding will come from Measure H renewal, Medi\u2011Cal Community Supports partnerships, and committed private co\u2011investors.\n\nContact\nFor questions: [CONTACT NAME, TITLE, EMAIL, PHONE].
